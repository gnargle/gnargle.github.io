                  It's 2015. December 23rd, to be exact. I'm sat in front of my
                  PC with my parents in the other room. And I'm crying.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's 2016. Sometime in May. I'm sitting on the bed with my
                  girlfriend in her flat in Sheffield. And I'm crying.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's 2017. I'm sitting in my partner's front room. We're
                  eating pizza. And I'm crying.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's 2022. I'm jumping up and down in the Bodega in
                  Nottingham. Anamanaguchi are playing their last song before
                  the encore. And I'm crying.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's 2025. I'm sat in a very hot concert hall the day before
                  I'm due to start back at work, two months after major surgery.
                  And I'm crying.
                </p>
                <p>All of these events have one thing in common: Undertale.</p>
                <p>
                  Undertale came out ten years ago today. One of the last smash
                  hit indies that would be released before the entire market
                  fractured and changed. It is unlike anything else released
                  that year. Or the previous year, or the next year. The only
                  game that will come close to Undertale is its
                  sequel/prequel/sidequel/something else Deltarune, but even
                  that isn't quite Undertale. Undertale both stands alone and
                  yet will also influence hundreds, if not thousands of games to
                  be released in the next decade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Undertale is something of a rosetta stone for the last decade
                  of video games. I think if you have any interest in the medium
                  it is a must-play. If you haven't, please stop reading now, as
                  I will be talking in less generic terms after the screenshot
                  here.
                </p>

                />
                <hr />
                <p>Ok, are they gone?</p>
                <p>
                  The common thread in those events is Undertale, yeah. But it's
                  more specifically Hopes and Dreams. What a track, huh? I can
                  only really think of two songs that equal it - one from
                  Stormblood, and one from Deltarune, of course. It's a track
                  that really captures the hype of the finale, but it's also
                  melancholic - the main melody, of course, is His Theme. The
                  fight itself at this point is bittersweet. You've SAVEd your
                  friends, you've perservered and stayed determined. The earth
                  refused to die. And all that's left, at the end of everything,
                  is a crying little boy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've never replayed Undertale myself. I played it through once
                  in 2015 and then kept the save, safe and backed up on my
                  desktop, for <i>years.</i> But I have watched two partners
                  play through it, and cried at the same points every time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I can't even listen to the title track without crying. That
                  walk through New Home... there's nothing else like it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's bizarre to say, maybe, but I think Toby Fox is a
                  generational talent. One day he'll be spoken of in the same
                  breath as people like Stephen King, David Lynch, Hideo Kojima
                  - incredibly impressive, omni-talented indivduals with
                  singular, totemic vision. I guess that would make Deltarune
                  Fox's Twin Peaks, his MGS3? It's only half-finished and it's
                  far beyond most works in the form. One can only imagine what
                  chapter 5 and on can bring.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But, yeah. Only played once. It feels... kinda wrong to play
                  it again? I never did a No Mercy route either. How could I
                  hurt all these characters I'd grown to love?
                </p>
                <p>
                  And then Deltarune arrived. And one of its many themes is the
                  horror of getting lost in escapism. Why do you care about
                  these characters? Why should you? They're not real, after all.
                  Ralsei even says it to camera.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's a rarity to see in games, a follow-up so in conversation
                  with its predecessor and with its fanbase. Deltarune chapter 1
                  retells Undertale, asks why you care, and then, after it's
                  broken you down, dares to ask: "after all that, is it still
                  you?" and plunges you into a new story about finding things
                  long thought lost in the dark.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's magical. And it wouldn't be possible at all without
                  Undertale; the game would not be able to deliver its gut punch
                  in even close to the same fashion if Undertale hadn't laid all
                  that ground work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Deltarune, impossibly, makes a once-in-a-generation game even
                  better. If, for some reason, you haven't played Deltarune,
                  this is your sign to do so. It will make Undertale even better
                  for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And if you kept reading anyway, despite my warning above:
                  please. Play Undertale. Then play Deltarune. Then DM me so we
                  can go insane together.
                </p>

                <p>
                  At the end of New Home, you reach a house. And in that house,
                  is a mirror. And you look in that mirror, at the end of your
                  journey. And it drops a line that has reverberated through
                  culture ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's been a decade. But despite everything, it's still you.

                  <b>Coda:</b>It is 22nd September 2025. I am watching the
                  Undertale 10th Anniversary Stream. Yet again, I am crying at
                  its ending. But I'm crying at so much more, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The message of the stream is shouted clearly throughout, but
                  is summarised best with the end card.
                </p>

                  Toby Fox is very online. He knows the breadth of mods,
                  fangames and metacontent that exists around his games. And he
                  openly invites everyone to play in the worlds he made, to
                  dance in the margins.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It makes me so happy. Canon doesn't matter. The world is as
                  big as you want it to be. Let's explore it all together.
                </p>
                <p>Happy 10th anniversary, Undertale. You changed my life.</p>
