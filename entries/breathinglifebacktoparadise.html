                <h1>
                  this blog post isnt ready yet. if you found it, congrats, i
                  like you. we can make out.
                </h1>
                <p>
                  The screenshot above looks pretty generic. Death Stranding 2
                  is a very beautiful game and its vistas are what make it. But
                  not all of them are particularly breathtaking, and I'll
                  happily admit the above image is one of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To me, though, it's very special. Because the spot in this
                  image is the very last road I needed to build to complete the
                  entire Australian highway. It's probably the greatest
                  achievement I've ever accomplished in a game. And it's
                  completely unremarked upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Completing the road network doesn't earn you a new tool, or a
                  playstation trophy. Hell, unlike opening all the monorails, it
                  doesn't even warrant a Social Strand Service post. I didn't
                  know this, before I set out on the endeavour to complete the
                  network. But it didn't matter if there was a reward - it was
                  <i>the right thing to do.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Death Stranding 2 is a game all about
                  <i>the right thing to do.</i> It applies on the macro level,
                  of course; pummelling Higgs is
                  <i>the right thing to do.</i> But every order you take, every
                  action in the world, every ladder and anchor you place, is
                  <i>the right thing to do.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kojima called Death Stranding the first game in a new genre,
                  the 'strand-type' game and while that might be grandiose, I
                  don't think he's strictly wrong. No other genre is as focused
                  on encouraging collaboration both inside and outside the
                  fourth wall, and it is undeniably successful. The whole game
                  is a joy of discovering a bit of cargo is positioned awkwardly
                  on a high ledge, then spotting a ladder from xXCriminalNukeXx
                  right next to it. Of course you're gonna hit the like button.

                  And the roads are the zenith of that idea. Restoring a road
                  between two destinations is a huge, expensive, multi-step
                  effort. It requires everyone involved to be completely
                  invested in the game, to be making side-quest deliveries to
                  get access to more resources, to expand the network. But the
                  reward it offers is unlike anything else - that challenging,
                  rough terrain that you've battled over to get to the paver is
                  instantly nullified by a flat, powered road.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finishing a road connection is instantly rewarding, yes, but
                  the game makes concerted efforts to reward it long-term, too.
                  You'll fairly regularly be asked to retrace your steps, to
                  make a delivery to a prior bunker. Without roads this is
                  challenging - albeit less challenging than the first time
                  through since the network will have other player's structures
                  populated in - but with a road, it feels like you're being
                  congratulated. "You have made this world better for everyone
                  who inhabits it. Take a victory lap."
                </p>
                <p>
                  I attached to the roads in the first game, and was rewarded
                  for it in a similar fashion - at the climax of DS, the chiral
                  network goes down, trashing all the structures you and others
                  have built. It's supposed to be one final test of what you've
                  learned. But if you built the roads, they remain and the
                  journey back to the start is trivial, that victory lap.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So I did the same in the second game, and it returned the
                  favour multiple times. But none of these events are a
                  traditional reward - it's purely generated from your own
                  knowledge of how much it would have sucked to backtrack
                  without it. It encourages you to <i>do the right thing.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  So I built out all the roads, continuing after the game ended,
                  when there was no chance of any backtracking missions. Because
                  building this infrastructure, for the people you meet, the
                  porters you have played alongside, and those who will come
                  after you, is <i>the right thing to do.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  You're probably thinking that's a bit pretentious. It's just a
                  video game, after all, and most of the characters in Death
                  Stranding are just holograms. But all of that artifice somehow
                  falls away, because you're making this world better, and
                  doesn't that feel good? Doesn't
                  <i>doing the right thing</i> feel good?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course it does. That's kind of the basis of most leftist
                  thinking, after all. The <i>right thing to do</i> may not be
                  the most optimal choice for you, personally - certainly
                  building every road was not optimal, the optimal choice would
                  be building roads just over the most tricky areas - but it
                  feels good to do it! It feels good to help others out!
                </p>
                <p>
                  There's only two strand-type games in existence, but another
                  2025 game actually comes... strangely close. It's a purely
                  single-player experience and it's called
                  <i>Promise Mascot Agency</i>, from the developers of
                  <i>Paradise Killer.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The high-level concept is batshit. You're a disgraced yakuza
                  who must transform a mismanaged love hotel into a successful
                  'mascot agency,' that rent out giant mascots to events. Except
                  the mascots are sentient, not costumes. And also it's secretly
                  a game about leaving a run-down, corrupt and forgotten town
                  much better than you found it.
