                  Pope Francis, in 2024, once used the phrase 'air of faggotry,'
                  which has since become the energy I wish to live my life
                  fuelled by. Since then, I have only got gayer. And part of how
                  I have only got gayer is by accidentally falling into becoming
                  polyamorous.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "A polyamorous transfemmer? Groundbreaking," I hear you say,
                  and it's true. Trans women do loooooove to be poly. But the
                  thing is, and bear with me here, I think it's because they
                  might be on to something?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cat and I first dabbled in polyamory the year prior, where we
                  ended up accidentally flirting too hard and fell into sexting
                  with our friend Ada. Anyone who knows me knows I've always
                  been a hideous flirt, but a bit too much drink and some THC in
                  the club later and before you know it I'm talking about how
                  much I want them to strap me. Whoops!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since then it's been kinda constant. We can't seem to make
                  friends without also ending up fucking them in some fashion.
                  And it's honestly been delightfully liberating?

                  There's still so much puritanism around sex. Christianity has
                  had a hell of a long reach. I think it's fair to say sex is
                  still widely considered to be divorced from friendship, that
                  your friends and your pursuits are separate and mixing them is
                  largely a Bad Idea.
                </p>

                  But, like, why? I know heterosexuality is a prison for many
                  people but, seriously, why? Sex is intimate, sure, but it's
                  also... fun? An entertaining way to spend an evening? A good
                  way to kill an hour? Why does it have to be reserved to a
                  special subset of people you usually haven't got to know
                  beforehand?
                </p>

                  It's weird to me. Hets are weird to me. Some of the best sex
                  I've had has been with people I've been friends with for ages!
                  Last year I flew across Europe to see and shag friends. We had
                  a sick evening together and then we hung out and went to a
                  museum the day after.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I guess it's because people think it'll impact your
                  friendship? But... I don't think that's really true? Not with
                  well-adjusted adults, anyway. We're always chatting with the
                  aforementioned pan-continental booty call and will be back to
                  hang out with them sometime soon. We stopped sexting with Ada
                  ages ago but talking with them is still a delight and
                  hopefully one day we'll manage to hang out with them IRL, when
                  US travel is a little less insane.

                  IDK what I hope to achieve with this post. Maybe I just wanna
                  brag? But I fuckin' love being poly, and I wanna yap about it
                  a little. I think more people should try it out! Free yourself
                  of the arbitrary restrictions the world puts on you. Obviously
                  if you're in a relationship discuss it with your partner first
                  though lmao that's just shitty otherwise. But yeah! It's just
                  fun, man. Sex isn't some big important event just have a good
                  time. Life's short and everyone you fuck will bring something
                  new and fun to your experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And if you're lucky, someone will say 'wow, there are great
                  acoustics in here' into your cunt, making you burst into fits
                  of laughter. It's moments like that that make life worth
                  living, baby.

                  Ah, now <i>that</i> was definitely why I wanted to make the
                  post.
