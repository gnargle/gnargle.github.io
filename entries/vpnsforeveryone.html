                  If you use one of many popular social networking sights and
                  are a resident of the hellhole commonly referred to as "The
                  United Kingdom," you have likely recently been asked to submit
                  your ID for age verification. If you haven't yet, it's coming
                  soon to whatever sites you use - Bluesky, as of this morning,
                  are asking every UK user to get an ID check in order to use
                  DMs or see 'adult' posts. Instagram and Facebook are about to
                  roll it out too. Twitter probably won't but only because it's
                  the nazi site. You should not be using twitter unless you're a
                  nazi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you're like me, you probably think this is Quite Bad. And
                  it is Quite Bad! The cause of this is the 'Online Safety Act,'
                  a well-intentioned but ultimately disastrous effort by the UK
                  government to Protect The Children by preventing easy access
                  to 'adult content.' Unfortunately as ever this means a lot of
                  not adult stuff, particularly queer media and LGBT people's
                  accounts, get caught in the dragnet. Considering the UK's
                  current approach to queerness (they hate it, especially
                  transgressive genderfucks like me) this may worry you. It
                  should.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, maybe you want to avoid uploading your ID to a third party
                  who can use that data how they then wish. (They all promise to
                  delete your ID. I do not trust them to do this.) Great news!
                  Much like all UK internet legislation, it is quite trivial to
                  avoid this. Admittedly, it is not as easy as avoiding IP
                  blocks on pirate websites, which was as simple as changing the
                  DNS settings on your connection. but it's not actually that
                  far off.

                  You have probably heard of VPNs by now. Every other youtuber
                  is advertising them. Unfortunately, they are advertising the
                  dogshit ones that you simply should not use if you care about
                  privacy. Surfshark, specifically, will not hesitate to hand
                  your data over to authorities. It should ONLY be used for
                  watching other country's netflix catalogues.
                </p>
                <p>But I digress.</p>
                <p>
                  As part of my own research to get around this, I had a scan
                  over the current crop of paid VPN services currently
                  available. After some evaluation, my recommendation is
                  <a href="https://protonvpn.com/"><b>ProtonVPN.</b></a> Proton
                  is a swiss company that specialises in privacy-focused
                  internet applications. They started with ProtonMail (which I
                  also use), but ProtonVPN is their next-most mature offering.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Proton offers exit points in basically every country in the
                  world, with quite a lot of servers in each. Speeds are solid
                  (I have basically not noticed a drop) and ping seems
                  serviceable for those of you who play a lot of twitch
                  shooters. The free offering lets you connect to 5 random
                  countries for one device, which isn't a whole lot of good - if
                  the countries you draw don't include say, Iceland, Switzerland
                  or the Netherlands, you're not gonna live a truly uncensored
                  life. The free tier is also what every other prole is using,
                  so speeds are going to be generally worse than on the paid pro
                  version. The pro version is <b>£8 a month</b> which is IMO
                  quite reasonable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like many other offerrings, Proton provides its own app on all
                  platforms that allows you to choose the country to connect
                  via, but it also supports router-level configuration via
                  OpenVPN and Wireguard, the two most common VPN protocols.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "What are these things?" ok yes I just said scary words. You
                  probably don't need to worry about it - the pro tier supports
                  10 independent devices, so you can install the VPN on every
                  geneal purpose computing device you have without worrying
                  about the router level stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But I'm a nerd, and the purpose of this particular post is to
                  inform people about these things! So let's get into those
                  scary words. OpenVPN and Wireguard are open-source VPN
                  protocols, they are used to standardise how you connect to a
                  VPN on any device. All the apps that VPN services provide are
                  based on one of these two protocols. Most modern routers
                  <i>that are not provided by your ISP</i> support one or both
                  of them!
                </p>
                <p>
                  So yes, if you want router-level protection you will probably
                  need to buy a new router, and realistically that's gonna be
                  another <b>£50 - £100.</b> Which I grant is a significant
                  outlay! Hence why I don't think any random person is going to
                  want to do this unless they're a nerd like me. I already
                  maintain a lot of my own network infrastructure, so yes, I'm
                  the freak here lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But! If you do go down that route, it's worthwhile, because
                  you can
                  <a
                    href="https://protonvpn.com/support/installing-protonvpn-on-a-router/"
                    >set up your network to route <i>all</i> traffic via your
                    VPN,</a
                  >
                  ensuring every device you use in your home is private. It's
                  what I'm doing! But like I said I'm a freak so don't
                  necessarily follow my lead on this one.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ANYWAY. Point is it's actually kinda trivial to get this nerd
                  shit set up nowadays! The apps services provide are simple and
                  easy, and they're also pretty cheap! I suggest getting one
                  now, before the continued censorship of the internet gets
                  worse! OK thanks I'm out, see ya later for a more interesting
                  post probably.
