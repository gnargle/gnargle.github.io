                Look I'm hardly the first to do this but I think we all know the
                internet is shit now. Like. Really, really shit. It would be
                naive to say that the internet was perfect in its early days.
                But it was definitely less centralised, with many people
                maintaining their own pages, using webrings to link to people
                they like. It was collaborative and communicative and a platform
                of passions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then for a while everyone was in the same place, although that
                place changed every like. year or so. I never really used
                MySpace or Bebo, but I got on Twitter really early and gave
                myself lifelong Poster's Sickness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Obviously Twitter is absolute shite now and has been for a fair
                while. I moved to bluesky, and that's ok, but every so often I
                want to write longer Things. Usually about movies or games,
                sometimes about programming stuff since that is... my job.
              </p>
              <p>
                I used backloggd for games for a bit but the culture on that
                site fucking annoyed me, and I don't think letterboxd is likely
                to be any better. So instead I can make my own website without a
                comment website. Then if you want to disagree with me you can dm
                me directly and then we can digitally kiss.
              </p>
              <p>
                So yeah. Programming is my job, and because the web is stupid
                now, most of what I work on is in Angular or Razor. Which do
                have their conveniences, but also they're kind of a pain when
                you just want to make something simple to scratch down thoughts
                in.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also I'm pretty sure an Angular SPA would get very mad at you if
                you tried to put a marquee tag in it. And since marquee is the
                greatest tag in the history of the web, we can't have that.
              </p>

                Anyway, that's probably it for this first entry. If you wanna
                find me elsewhere, check the links below, else ta for now love.
