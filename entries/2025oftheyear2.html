                Like many trannies, I keep a media list on my bluesky every
                year. Here's a bit more details on my favourite things from this
                year.
              </p>
              <p>
                The list is already in the FILMS post so I won't repeat it here.
                If you missed that one you can find it
                <a href="2025oftheyear.html">HERE.</a> OK. On with the show.
                Today's words are about VIDEO GAMES.
              </p>
              <h3>VIDEO GAMES</h3>
              <h4>5. Fallout: New Vegas</h4>
              <p>
                I've already <a href="newvegas.html">talked at length</a> about
                New Vegas and I'm not gonna yap about it again, but suffice to
                say it has truly only grown on me with time. It's a game full of
                delightful and fascinating narrative decisions, of interwoven
                narrative chaos.I'm quite looking forward to going back to it
                and siding with Caesar's Legion or the NCR and seeing more of
                the way that world fits together. The more you play it, the more
                it invites you in - I really love it, I can't lie.
              </p>
              <p>
                Admittedly, this one is, similar to Summer Wars, not exactly an
                earth-shaking revelation. Did you know famously good game is
                good? Well, yeah, idiot. But it is, and I'm glad I finally got
                to see what all the fuss was about.
              </p>
              <h4>4. Hollow Knight: Silksong</h4>
              <p>
                So I played Hollow Knight through this year for the first time
                and was left a pretty distinct 'is that it' feeling coming out
                of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like. It's fine? It's good, even. But the way people talk about
                Hollow Knight, you'd think it was absolutely revelatory, like
                Metroidvanias were basically shit before it.
              </p>
              <p>
                And it's just not true, obviously. I would pitch Hollow Knight
                as roughly as good as Zero Mission - perfectly fun, but nothing
                that special.
              </p>
              <p>Silksong, though? Hoooooooly fuck.</p>
              <p>
                I played Silksong in literally the best way possible - avoiding
                online discussion, spoilers and guides, just sharing hints with
                a friend who was also playing it. It made it so incredibly
                special. Together we puzzled out how to do the rasher, what was
                in those mysteriously empty parts of the map, even how to get to
                act 3 and get the fourth heart. It was, genuinely, like no other
                experience I've had. Finally, I was getting what other people
                said was so good about Hollow Knight.
              </p>
              <p>
                Silksong is, truly, a world to get lost in. Much akin to Super
                Metroid and Fusion, every single nook and cranny is hiding
                something for you in some fashion, and every reward feels game
                changing.
              </p>
              <p>
                A single health upgrade is enormous in Silksong. A new move or
                crest can completely alter the way you play the game. Everything
                it offers up to you is delightful in some way. Sometimes, the
                reward (as in the Green Prince questline) is just a secret area
                - in itself incredible to see and experience. It's a game in
                relishes in giving you more, more than you asked for, more than
                you could ever have imagined. I am delighted to have played it
                blind.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's been a lot of consternation about the difficulty of the
                game, and about the relative annoyance of its corpse running. My
                main comment on this is that it wasn't really something I
                experienced so can't comment on it too much, lol. I only really
                walled on a few optional bosses - the Last Judge et al weren't
                actually that difficult for me. I have however Onebro'd Dark
                Souls and am a high-level rhythm gamer so my calibration for
                difficulty is very different from the average player, I think.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm glad I beat all the bosses pre-nerf. I sit firmly in the
                'difficulty is an intentional choice, not every game is for
                everyone' camp, and I do find it absurd that we have this
                conversation every year. War and Peace is a Difficult Book for
                being so long. The Odyssey is a Difficult Read because it's
                written all weird. But we don't argue that these books should be
                'made easier' for less experienced readers. IDK. I think it
                speaks to games' immaturity as an art form that we continue to
                debate this instead of letting a game just... be.
              </p>
              <p>
                But then, the artists themselves can't leave well enough alone.
                There are so many remakes now. Why has Silent Hill 2 been
                remade? Why Resident Evil 4? These are pillars of the form!
              </p>
              <p>
                I digress. I loved Silksong and think it's a great game to
                persevere with. Let's move on to the next game in the list:
              </p>
              <h4>3. Deltarune: Chapters 3 and 4</h4>
              <p>
                OH MY GOD IT'S ANOTHER GAME WITH A CONTROVERSIAL BOSS THAT I'M
                GLAD I FOUGHT PRE-NERF. I CAN'T ESCAPE!
              </p>
              <p>
                But seriously folks. Deltarune is here, with two new chapters,
                and it's absolutely incredible. I am in love with Deltarune.
                Toby Fox is a modern genius, at once an incredible writer,
                musician and game designer producing games that arguably define
                a genre for a generation. Like Undertale before it, Deltarune is
                truly seminal work, at once effortlessly funny, genuinely
                moving, and deeply creepy all at once.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just <i>what</i> is going on with Noelle and the weird route?
                What is the purpose of the eggs? How the hell does Gaster fit
                into everything? I spend at least an hour a day thinking about
                Deltarune, and that shows no signs of stopping.
              </p>
              <p>
                And the <i>music.</i> Good lord the music in this game. Imagine
                producing a track like It's TV Time! and it not even being the
                best song of the chapter. There is literally nobody out there
                doing it like Tricky Toby Fox. It's honestly crazy how good this
                soundtrack is. I can't wait for Chapter 5 for many reasons, but
                a new album of Toby Fox music is maybe chief amongst them.
              </p>
              <p>
                And that's not even <i>touching</i> how it plays. The bullet
                hell dodging has only got better since Undertale, and the way in
                which Fox and Co deliver characterisation for minor enemies
                through their bullet patterns is genuinely inspired. Secret
                bosses remain the highlight (sitting there and spending hours
                breaking chapter 3's in two was a moment only equalled by the
                first time I ever beat Ornstein and Smough, frankly) but the
                creativity on display even for midbosses and chapter bosses
                really has to be applauded. What a game.
              </p>
              <p>
                It remains to be seen if it can stick the landing, but whatever
                happens, I'm along for the ride for the long haul. Long live
                Deltarune.
              </p>
              <h4>2. Blue Prince</h4>
              <p>
                A manor sits at the crest of a hill. It's yours, now, so long as
                you can find your way to room 46. Unfortunately, the manor only
                has 45 rooms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hook of Blue Prince is simple. The reality of Blue Prince is
                a spiral, a mystery that grows ever deeper. A lost family
                member. A country in turmoil. A language you cannot read. A
                system of mathematics to comprehend. A throne that sits empty. A
                red prince, and a swimming bird.
              </p>
              <p>
                Blue Prince took my breath away. It's a game designed entirely
                around that first moment of wonder from Breath of the Wild,
                where you leave the cave and see the world. But here, it's not
                seeing the world that leaves you winded - it's the solution to a
                puzzle you've been ruminating on for hours. It's the subtle
                implication in a book you read in the library. It's the ominous
                feeling that you're being watched. Everything in Blue Prince
                invites curiosity and if you will let it, it'll drag you down in
                its spiral, poisoning your every thought until it finally lets
                you free, far beyond where you ever thought it'd take you..
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't want to spoil a minute of Blue Prince, so I'll leave
                this entry here. Just know that to be higher on this list than
                Deltarune, a game must be truly, magnificently special.
              </p>
              <p>Which leads me on to...</p>
              <h4>1. UNBEATABLE</h4>
              <h4 class="centre-content">
                <i
                  >You're just a part of my life... and I can't get rid of
                  you.</i
                >
              </h4>
              <p>
                UNBEATABLE (all caps or no caps), as I said on bluesky, made me
                feel shrimp emotions. It's kind of a mess. Structurally,
                technically, whatever. It's the most raw expression of a team's
                emotion I've ever felt in a video game, to the extent that I
                think this is now a game I will recommend to <i>everyone</i> in
                the same fashion I do for Undertale.
              </p>
              <p>
                At its core, unbeatable is a fairly simple two-key rhythm game.
                And it is a <i>sublime</i> rhythm game. I was pretty critical of
                the charting in White Label and the demo, often feeling like the
                maps barely fit to the rhythm of the song. I am delighted to say
                that all the issues I had with that are gone in the full
                release. The maps are by and large fantastic, pushing you deep
                into a flow state.
              </p>
              <p>
                UNBEATABLE: ARCADE was clearly designed by people with a deep,
                burning love of JP rhythm games. The rating system is ripped
                straight from them (although thankfully without decay, my
                beloathed) and I'm so glad it's here, chasing rating is a unique
                thrill to rhythm games and seeing that little 'rating up' after
                you've cleared a new difficulty frontier or upscored hard in a
                track you struggled with is the crack cocaine form of dopamine.
                If it gets its claws in you, you'll be in for it for a damn
                while. And good job too.
              </p>
              <p>
                And yeah, on its own, UNBEATABLE ARCADE would be in this top 5
                list. Probably in the 5 spot. But the story mode. Ohhhhh man.
              </p>
              <p>
                Again, no spoilers from me - but one of the first things you see
                in the game is something called 'One More Final.' And that
                instantly had me go 'oh, this team are on my wavelength.' This
                is a game in love with anime, of course - its full of
                environments you'd expect to see in Love Live!, bright sunny
                vistas. And it's interesting to contrast that to another game
                that heavily referenced Evangelion, my most hated game of 2024,
                Mouthwashing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mouthwashing was a game that felt like it had no real identity
                of its own. All its most impressive moments were stolen directly
                from Evangelion, transplanted into a work with nothing original
                or interesting to say. It sucked total ass.
              </p>
              <p>
                UNBEATABLE also takes a lot of cues from Eva, in many forms, but
                instead of shamelessly stealing, it builds a world and a story
                and an identity all its own. 'One More Final' is ripped from
                EoE, sure, but it's also a statement of intent. And man. It
                delivers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will probably have a more spoiler-riffic post on unbeatable at
                some point because it does some truly incredible stuff in its
                latter hours. But that's not for now.
              </p>
              <p>
                For now: please, if you choose to play or watch something from
                this list, make it UNBEATABLE. It's my favourite game of the
                year. It's probably my favourite game of the 2020s so far. It
                shoots for the moon. Maybe it doesn't quite make it - but it
                sure lands among the stars.
