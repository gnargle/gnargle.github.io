                OK this is a silly post but my friends asked me for a full
                review of the new kfc zinger double down. So here it is.
              </p>
              <p>
                The double down is The Goblin Meal To End All Goblin meals. Two
                chicken fillets as the buns in a burger, with something
                (previously bacon, now a hash brown) in the middle. It sounds
                horrible and honestly it kind of is, but that good kind of
                horrible that you only get with a really grotty fast food meal.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's awful. I love it. Haven't had one since they were last
                about in idk, 2019?
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyway they've made a new one and today I ate it. Was it good?
                Let's find out!
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>OK I have just finished eating it. It is Bad.</p>
              <p>
                The old double down was bad, but you kinda knew what you were
                getting. It was just two slabs of chicken, a bit of processed
                cheese, and a slice of bacon. In reality those other two
                elements didn't make much of a dent in the flavour profile and
                all you really tasted was KFC chicken.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some elements are still ok, the chicken is fine, the cheese is
                still shite but edible. But god, the hash brown?
              </p>
              <p>
                The addition of the hash brown messes with both the consistency
                and the flavour; it's now a weird mess of stodge that is
                honestly quite unpleasant in the mouth.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will admit, me aging and the diet I've been on in prep for
                surgery in March has changed my response to a lot of fast food;
                I had a dominos pizza the other week as a treat and I simply did
                not like it anymore. So me disliking it may not all be on the
                double down, but it certainly didn't help itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                So yeah do not rate. I wouldn't buy it if I were you. 3/10.
                Alright cheers everyone see you in the next post.
