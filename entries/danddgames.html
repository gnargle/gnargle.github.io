                OK, now I've got my hot take out the way, let's talk about a fun
                game from 2013 called Call of Juarez: Gunslinger that is very
                much not the game I have been playing. I promise I'll bring it
                round though.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Call of Juarez series isn't particularly interesting outside
                of this title. They're very average Western first-person
                shooters from the late noughties and early 2010s. I imagine,
                having not gone back to them, that they are also probably quite
                racist. One of them is about two brothers fighting in the civil
                war who desert as the 'war nears its end,' which sure sounds
                like they were on the losing side.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gunslinger, however, is different. It's actually a game about
                storytelling. You're Silas, a cowboy sat in a saloon telling his
                life story - the hook of the game being that Silas is an
                unreliable narrator. As Silas tells the story, and the people
                around him pick holes in his tale, the world you're playing in
                changes rapidly. The launch trailer shows how that works, skip
                to 1:12 for the relevant bit.

                And this is extremely cool, right? It feels futuristic, and
                honestly it feels like kind of how the future of video games
                should have been. But I don't think I ever saw this kinda thing
                again? We have 'dynamic' worlds in some sense in that a building
                will fall down, or a new route opens up somehow, but nothing on
                the scale of the world shifting around the player.
              </p>
              <p>
                And I do understand why. This, as with anything, is down to
                budget. if you have a scene that changes as the story changes,
                that's expensive. But it feels kind of revolutionary in a way
                that, frankly, I don't think video games have felt in a long,
                long time.
              </p>
              <p>
                So yeah, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger. Cool experiment, fun game,
                weird vision into a future that never was.

                Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a 2022 Borderlands spin-off that
                <i>is</i> that imagined future.
              </h3>
              <p>
                OK, preface, I know that one of the words in that sentence has
                probably immediately turned off quite a lot of people reading
                this. I am aware Borderlands is extremely marmite. I have played
                most of the games and I would struggle to call any of them
                "great" - they're competent shooters, they nail the
                looter-shooter loop that so many games since have tried and
                failed to imitate (Destiny has and will always suck, don't
                start) and they are famously groan-worthy when it comes to
                writing and story.
              </p>
              <p>
                I played quite a few games in January and towards the end I was
                itching for a shooter, ideally one fit for the Steam Deck. I'd
                tried Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel before and bounced off it, but
                I picked it up for another go on Valve's miracle machine and had
                a great time. I think that game is helped by it being developed
                by 2K Australia, a studio with Bioshock pedigree, so it's a
                really really solid shooter; but it's also honestly pretty funny
                when it gets to be properly Australian. it also leans heavily on
                Handsome Jack, the antagonist of Borderlands 2, and inarguably
                the series' highpoint when it comes to character writing. it
                still has its 'cringe' moments, but I think it's generally
                better written than 2 (and certainly 3) and also it has lasers.
                Which are fun.
              </p>
              <p>
                After finishing that, I remembered I'd tried Tiny Tina's
                Wonderlands on deck sometime in 2023. it didn't run
                <i>great,</i> muddy visuals and a very janky framerate making it
                pretty painful to actually play. But hey, these things get
                patched, and after a reinstall and some fussing in the settings
                (specifically, turning FSR2 on and setting it to 'Balanced') I
                ended up with a game that both looked pretty reasonable and ran
                very well! It's 60fps most of the time, but does drop to
                mid-forties when the vistas are big or there's an excessive
                amount going on on-screen. But it's certainly playable.
              </p>
              <p>
                With those fixes in place, I rolled a new character and dove in.
                About an hour in, after the tutorial has concluded and you enter
                the main town to find it ransacked, the game's magic trick
                begins. Fighting your way to the centre square and freeing 'Butt
                Stallion,' the kingdom's ruler (yes, I know. Unfortunately this
                one is a Gearbox in-house production, with all that entails),
                Tiny Tina, the DM of the game, tells you about the city
                repairing itself in typical lyrical DM fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
                And then the city changes around you. Fires extinguish, bricks
                that had crashed to the ground float and repair into pristine
                buildings. Rainbows sprout around the castle. It's honestly
                pretty magnificent to watch.
              </p>
              <p>
                This isn't actually the first time the game has pulled this
                trick, but it;'s the first time your focus isn't on the combat,
                so it's hard to ignore. Earlier, as youre fighting towards the
                town, Tina describes a siege happening around you, and in an
                adjacent field, siege engines, vast armies, ramparts and
                defences materialise, a battle suddenly taking place where
                before there was green grass and tranquil hills. She details a
                ship full of skeletons and it shores up next to you, a fresh
                barrage of foes to fight.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's hard to overstate how magic this feels, and it's spread all
                through the game. The grander changes to the world around you
                are kept for story beats, of course, but this game being a tale
                told at a D&D table is weaved throughout in other ways.
                Borderlands isn't exactly a choice-heavy RPG, the main quest is
                laid before you already written, and side quests can only really
                go one way as well, with maybe a minor amount of variation. But
                in that outwardly restricting framework is how the spirit of
                TTRPGs thrives here. You can choose to seduce a character
                instead of fighting them in one side quest; a D&D classic. Your
                other friends at the table talk amongst themselves, arguing
                rules or paths forward, making dice checks and complaining to
                the DM.
              </p>
              <p>
                And honestly, I think it's an interesting way of adapting a D&D
                session to a video game! Baldurs Gate and its ilk are
                laser-focused on player choice in both the micro and macro, they
                implement the rules and functions of a tabletop rpg as if
                they're set in stone, the inarguable realities of these games.
                But isn't the real magic of TTRPGs in the unexpected? Humans are
                unpredictable; a video game is never able to expand the
                possibility space in a way a human DM can.
              </p>
              <p>
                So instead, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands doesn't try to. You're the
                player character, but the players themselves are the others at
                the table, improvising and adapting. The result is a game that
                <i>feels</i> closer to playing D&D than any CRPG ever could,
                even if the choices are entirely out of your hands.
              </p>
              <p>
                It means that these wild storytelling swerves can be designed
                for. Baldurs Gate 3 couldn't have an entire ocean evaporate,
                entirely changing the world, because, well - what if the player
                chooses not to do it? By being strictly linear, the world feels
                strangely more real than Faerun ever did for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's not to say the spectre of budget constraints don't haunt
                the game, mind. Unlike every other Borderlands game, the world
                isn't contiguous, instead each 'adventuring area' is separated
                by an overworld, which is designed to resemble a DM's map, with
                miniatures dotting it. It acts kind of like a classic Final
                Fantasy overworld. There's also the audiologs/comms of the game,
                which appear on screen without even an ease-in fade - suddenly
                there's a character's unanimated face in the top-right of your
                screen as they speak.
              </p>
              <p>
                And I will admit it's distracting. It feels like the cuts taken
                to accommodate the wild creativity elsewhere can be pretty
                brutal and in many cases stick out like a sore thumb. But
                personally? I think it's worth it.
              </p>
              <p>
                You don't get to take swings this big without sacrificing some
                parts of the game that would usually have zero rough edges. But
                I'd always rather a game be ambitious and occasionally cut you
                with their rawness than be designed-by-committee, smoothed over
                globs of nothing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite ultimately being just another Borderlands, I will be
                remembering beats in Wonderlands for far, far longer than
                anything 2 or 3 offered up. And that's something that really
                should be celebrated.
