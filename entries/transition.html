                  On 11/04/2025 I finally got 'the op.' And I feel some kinda
                  way about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is gonna be quite a personal entry, as you might imagine.
                  And while I wander into a lot of personal thoughts and
                  feelings generally in my entries, this is closer than most,
                  and the physical and mental scars are still fresh. So bear
                  with me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've been in the gender care system in the UK for roughly a
                  decade at this point. That's charting from first referral from
                  my GP. It took about 5 years from that point to get seen by
                  Notts GIC, a year to be put on hormones, and around 4 more to
                  finally be slapped on to an operating table. Let's be clear.
                  This is an unacceptable amount of time for a person to wait
                  for life-saving treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And it is life-saving. I'm not sure surgery specifically was
                  for me, more on that in a bit, but the myriad dysphorias that
                  come with being trans are huge risk factors. Getting on HRT
                  was life-saving for me, certainly. If I hadn't had a very
                  loving partner to help me through the early years I likely
                  wouldn't have hit that 6 year mark when I could finally begin
                  it 'officially.'
                </p>
                <p>
                  DIYing is commonplace of course, but when I began my
                  transition, I was alone and scared and didn't know a single
                  other trans person who could have helped me access hormones.
                  So the Legal Route was the only way I could do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For anyone beginning transition today, all I can say is: do
                  not wait. Break the law and biohack your body. If you live in
                  the UK, our healthcare is only getting worse. There is still
                  time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But yeah. Surgery. I've never had major surgery before. I
                  didn't know what to expect going in. The care I received at
                  Nuffield Brighton was exemplary from start to finish and is a
                  huge reason I didn't panic, but I still panicked a
                  <i>bit,</i> especially after we ended up waiting for around 5
                  hours between check-in and actual surgery time. The
                  anaesthetist gave me an epidural, which very nearly made me
                  feint (bad!) but I didn't because the other anaesthetist held
                  on to me very tightly (good!). Then I got put to sleep for 3
                  hours, woke up in recovery, chatted shit about chocolate bars
                  and got wheeled back to my ward.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I say ward. Private hospital, so it was a private room,
                  swanky. I think that was good overall? But I did feel pretty
                  lonely when all the various healthcare people had done their
                  morning rounds and there was still multiple hours before Cat
                  could come visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That first evening after surgery was pretty chill by virtue of
                  still being stoned from the epidural and the anaesthetic. The
                  first two days after surgery sucked. I wasn't allowed to get
                  up, so was on my back all day, which it turns out gives you
                  horrendous trapped wind. Which also really, really hurts. Pain
                  from my surgery was actually fairly minimal, most pain I had
                  those first few days was wind. Bodies are so stupid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then the next day I was sitting up, and walking, and
                  showering, and I saw her for the first time. If you're a
                  friend, you've probably already seen the photos. If you
                  haven't, ask me if you're curious and I'll DM you. It's a
                  medical miracle, honestly. Hats off to my surgeon, Mr. Larner,
                  he can really invert a penis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then I was packed off home for two weeks housebound, with a
                  further 6-8 weeks of recovery after that. And that's the lot.
                  I'm officially at the end of the gender clinic pipeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And now, I feel kinda strange. So much of my life has been
                  defined by this journey. The waiting, the phone calls, the
                  fighting and pain and misery of battling a system designed to
                  gatekeep as many people from transitioning as possible. I won.
                  And my prize is to just... live my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's... weird. Discombobulating. I think I feel really adrift
                  right now. Being cooped up in the house 24/7 doesn't help of
                  course, but I feel purposeless. I've been playing a lot of
                  Blue Prince, and it honestly kinda feels like the run after
                  reaching 46. The goal has been achieved, the crown sits atop
                  your head. So what next?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Living my life is next, I guess. The popular concept of
                  transition is largely medical, and while I have been socially
                  transitioned for a long, long time, I'm interested what doors
                  surgery will open for me. I suddenly feel safer, for one, even
                  despite the country I live in. If some odious terf decides to
                  genital inspect me, then well... they're gonna be surprised.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And while for me my dick never caused me enormous amounts of
                  dysphoria, I'm excited about what new opportunities I have
                  now. I can wear leggings without a skirt. I can go swimming
                  with no worries. I can have lots of weird, new and exciting
                  sex. The world is bright and wide and I am very lucky to be
                  able to experience a whole new side of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So I'm choosing not to see this as an end. This is a new
                  beginning, and I'm sat in Ube-Shinkawa Station, ready for the
                  world. I just hope it's ready for me.
                </p>

                  I made an alternative image for this entry, because much like
                  Eva this is both an ending and a beginning. I think I like the
