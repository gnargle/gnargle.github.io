                  Earlier this year I played Obsidian's Pentiment, which I
                  adored. Fabulous little game with choices that really mattered
                  and a genuine reverence and love for history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've tangled with Obsidian's games a few times to varying
                  degress of success. Their South Park games are a good laugh,
                  the Outer Worlds is weird and awkward and well, New Vegas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've played an awful lot of Fallout 3 and 4. Bethesda's games
                  have a certain je ne sais quois that really makes them a
                  delight, despite not being particularly good in... well, any
                  respect. Fallout, especially, has a real magic in it; between
                  the fantastic tech assets (the Pip-Boy, of course, but all the
                  vault mechanisms, the terminals... they all feel so suited to
                  the setting), the sublime score and radio that set the mood
                  and some very moody storytelling in each location, it's easy
                  to get lost in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite that, mind, I'd never managed to get into New Vegas,
                  although not for lack of trying. Every year or so, I'd go
                  'maybe this time it'll take' and then, without fail, I'd bail
                  around Primm. There was a fair amount of stuff that didn't gel
                  with me in it, most notably the fact that early doors it's a
                  <i>damn</i> hard game if you don't have Guns as a tag skill. I
                  knew, of course, that a lot of the quests can be solved
                  non-violently, so I'd usually put all three tag skills in
                  non-violent skills too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not this time, though. This time I finished a playthrough, and
                  smashed through the DLC, too. I tagged Guns, Science and
                  Speech, which was a massive help. A massive help, really -
                  tagging GUns makes the early game less brutal, and I still had
                  plenty of points in skill check stats for early-game speech
                  challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Which, honestly, made the game an awful lot more fun. Suddenly
                  I wasn't doing chip damage on every single enemy and counting
                  down the bullets till I was punching them. It made that
                  initial journey to Primm and beyond a lot less gruelling.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Anyway, turns out everyone who wasn't me was extremely right
                  about this game. It's <i>delightful.</i> The shooting is still
                  the same as in Fallout 3, which is to say, it's kind of
                  rubbish, but everything around it rules. Being able to level
                  Speech to 100 and talk down everyone in the game, even the
                  Legion's Turbo Nazi? THRILLING. Meeting a guy at a solar farm
                  and using your high science skill to correctly deduce he has
                  no idea what he's doing? Phenomenal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sheer possibility landscape in the game kind of beggars
                  belief, to the extent that you kind of wonder how they even
                  fit it all in. And <i>especially</i> how they managed to put
                  it all together in just 18 months. How are there three
                  different major factions you can side with on the strip, each
                  with full-featured and intertwined storylines? How is there an
                  ADDITIONAL 'no thanks' questline that lets you take Vegas
                  independent? How come every place you go to in the Mojave has
                  at least two or three quests attached to it, even if it's a
                  single-purpose location like a Vault?
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's the kind of elegant design you simply don't see, really.
                  Bethesda certainly don't do it. Baldurs Gate 3 kind of came
                  close, at least in terms of density of quests, although it
                  definitely doesn't have the same quality in its choices. Even
                  Obsidian don't seem to have matched it, although granted I've
                  not played Avowed much or ever touched Pillars of Eternity.
                  Maybe they've cracked that nut again in those.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Anyway, yeah. Good game! The DLC is pretty mediocre, although
                  I really loved Old World Blues. That one specifically is
                  buoyed by the Think Tank being so weird and fun and tragic?
                  Maybe that's just me having 'old world blues,' myself, though
                  - I do think the best writing in all of the Fallout games is
                  when it's confronting the pre-war world and contrasting it
                  with the current wasteland.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But yeah. All this to say: if you were waiting for a sign to
                  finally play New Vegas, this is it. It's ruddy bloody
                  brilliant.
