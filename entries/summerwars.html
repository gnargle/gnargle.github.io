                  This is the second in a series of posts about Mamoru Hosoda's
                  films. The previous entry can be found
                  <a href="thegirlwholeaptthroughtime.html">here.</a> The next
                  one will be available in a few weeks.

                  It's 2009. The iPhone is brand new. The Wii and the DS are
                  juggernauts, sitting in nearly every home in Japan. The
                  internet is no longer the reserve of weird nerds and
                  teenagers: it has well and truly <b>arrived.</b> Your boss
                  posts on facebook. Brands have signed up to twitter.

                  But even as the world becomes ever more digital, the world
                  keeps turning, and summer arrives just as it always has.

                  The Girl Who Leapt Through Time may have leant on nostalgia,
                  but it was also a remarkably forward thinking film. It asks
                  the viewer to savour the time they're given, to look to the
                  future with bright eyes. Summer Wars, meanwhile, is a
                  remarkably futurist film, imaging a world where everything,
                  from train timetables to microwaves to provincial government,
                  is controlled through one central, worldwide application. And
                  yet, despite all that Summer Wars is a film about history.

                <p>
                  I'm being a little bit facetious here - the A-plot in Summer
                  Wars is undeniably a sci-fi bananza, but it is also a straight
                  remake of Hosoda's earlier work on Digimon: Our War Game. You
                  may know it as the middle third of Digimon: The Movie.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And look, fair cop to Hosoda - he fuckin' nailed it with that
                  short. It survived basically uncut into the movie (which
                  cannot be said of the other two shorts that make it up) and
                  then gets remade with the serial numbers filed off in Summer
                  Wars, and it <i>still absolutely rips.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the magic of Summer Wars is how it weaves the story of the
                  Jinnouchi clan through each beat of the a-plot. Wabisuke and
                  Sakae are the most important members to the plot, being the
                  creator of Love Machine and the matriarch of the family,
                  respectively, but each member has a chance to shine in their
                  own way.
