                I'm transgender, I'm autistic, and I was born in the early 90s.
                Naturally, this means I have formed a lifelong attachment to
                Sonic the Hedgehog.
              </p>
              <p>
                It started with Sonic 2 on the Mega Drive, which I played
                basically all the time. My dad had written down the cheat codes
                for level select, debug and all emeralds in the back of the
                manual, and I spent tens if not hundreds of hours messing with
                the object placement mode. My first experience getting in the
                guts of a computer, even if it was in a relatively safe way.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was lucky enough to get a Gamecube at launch in May 2002, with
                Sonic Adventure 2. You could probably really pinpoint that as
                the end for me. Sonic Adventure 2 was so <i>cool.</i> It still
                <i>is</i> cool, despite being (in the cold, modern light of day)
                really only about 1/5th good game and 4/5ths shite.
              </p>
              <p>
                But it's a game that feels cohesive. It builds up a strange
                world through the action stages, the Chao garden, the
                multiplayer stages... it feels like a whole. It's unsurprising
                that it too sucked me in, as it did many many others.
              </p>
              <p>
                I continued playing different Sonic games throughout my
                childhood and, still, into adulthood. One of my fave games of
                last year was Shadow Generations, for god's sake. It's the most
                uneven series I still stick with, but it's hard to quit Sonic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometime in my teenage years, around when I was 12 or 13, I
                started digging into Sonic fangames. I played the demo of the
                very first version of the Retro Engine, which would eventually
                by used by its creator, Christian Whitehead (among others) to
                make Sonic Mania. I fooled around with romhacks a lot. I spent a
                lot of time browsing Sonic Retro and Sonic Cult (deep cut!),
                digging through all sorts of info about sonic betas, And also
                learning what the words 'hentai doujinshi' meant. Some of my
                first porn was Sonic art. Probably explains Why I'm Like This.

                Relive my sexual awakening with me. The warnings for Furry Bomb
                said to only download if I promised I wasn't a minor, which I
                dutifully ignored. Wonder if I can get a copy of one of these
                from Mandarake one day.
                <a href="https://imhentai.xxx/gallery/4195/">#5</a> was my
                favourite.
              </p>
              <p>
                ANYWAY, I DIGRESS. What were we talking about? Fangames, right?
                OK so yeah, Sonic has had a fantastic fangame scene basically
                from its inception, right to the present day. I look forward to
                SAGE every year, an event that started in humble sonic hack
                beginnings and is now a celebration of hacks, fangames and
                original indie titles inspired by Sonic. I usually tweet about
                some of the games I sample, so look out for that in June.
              </p>
              <p>
                But when it comes to fangames, there's one that really stands
                out, above all others. It's older than most of them. It's
                definitely been in development longest.
              </p>
              <p>It's Sonic Robo Blast 2.</p>

                SRB2 is, flatly, bananas. It's a 3D Sonic game that
                <i>predates</i> Sonic Adventure. (Technically. SRB2 started off
                as a 2D fangame in early 1998, then moved to 3D engine in 1999.
                So it didn't beat Sonic Adventure to the 3D punch really, but it
                was damn close.) It's built on a fork of the Doom engine, with
                slopes and room-over-room (something that is still rare in
                modern doom source ports!) as well as more conventional
                platformer mechanics. It has its own interpretation of how Sonic
                should feel in 3D, heavily inspired by the physics and
                momentum-based structure of the 2D games. The cornerstones of
                how SRB2 feels to play have gone on to influence countless other
                3D Sonic fangames.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started playing it in the 'Final Demo' era, which despite the
                name was not in fact the final demo before its full release. In
                fact, SRB2 is still not finished. it's now at version 2.2, with
                6/8 zones done. Which I guess sounds like it's taking forever,
                but it should be noted that SRB2 isn't just an ordinary
                singleplayer fangame. It's actually chock full of an insane
                amount of features. At current blush:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Singleplayer campaign with 6 complete zones, one incomplete
                  zone, and one final boss zone.
                </li>
                <li>6 playable characters, each with unique movesets.</li>
                <li>5 Bonus single-act zones.</li>
                <li>
                  8 singleplayer Special Stages - implemented as a full
                  recreation of NiGHTS into Dreams (!)
                </li>
                <li>7 multiplayer blue-sphere-esque Special Stages</li>
                <li>4 NiGHTS bonus stages</li>
                <li>
                  <i>An entire Doom-inspired FPS multiplayer mode</i> with CTF,
                  and Deathmatch gamemodes, with 37 maps.
                </li>
                <li>
                  1 bonus level that utilises a special 'Mario Mode,' that
                  emulates Mario-style gameplay.
                </li>
                <li>
                  1 special legacy zone that serves as a playable museum of the
                  'final demo' version of the game.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>That's a lot of game for the low low price of free!</p>
              <p>
                Playing this game on and off for years, it's amazing to see both
                how the game's grown, but also how it feels so similar to the
                game I played at 13 or whatever. I have no doubt since the
                'final demo' that the physics have been tweaked and rewritten
                multiple times, but the coolest thing about SRB2 is playing it
                now, it feels how I remember, unlike, say, Sonic Adventure. The
                hazy, rose-tinted specs of youth make you forgive a lot of sins
                in games, so it's really neat that SRB2 manages to feel great
                while not betraying how you remember it being.
              </p>
              <h3>BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!</h3>
              <p>
                Because SRB2 is built on Doom, it itself is extremely moddable.
                And, like Sonic, the community around SRB2 has been extremely
                active since day 1. There's a veritable bonanza of custom maps
                and characters, with bespoke art and movesets and even brand new
                mechanics to support them. As a kid I dove deep into this,
                having fun with tens of weird different characters from all
                across the Sonic canon and beyond. Now I'm revisiting, I've only
                touched one (a fantastic Modern Sonic implementation) but god,
                what depth.
              </p>
              <h3>BUT THAT'S STILL NOT ALL!</h3>
              <p>
                SRB2 has itself spawned some fabulous total conversion mods, the
                most well-known of which is SRB2 Kart, and its sequel, DR.

                />
              </a>
              <p>
                That's right baby, I bamboozled you again! This entire blog post
                was here to advertise DR ROBOTNIK'S RING RACERS to you! Ring
                Racers is a highly technical kart racer, that (in my humble
                opinion) unseats Mario, the king of karts, with absolute ease.
                Over 230 tracks! 63 characters! 22 power ups! A Smash Bros style
                unlock wall (fantastic to see this mechanic outside of a Sakurai
                game!) Battle mode! Boss battles!?
              </p>
              <p>
                Ring Racers really feels like it took the precedent set for
                exceeding expectation by SRB2, looked at it, and went "yeah,
                that's small fry. Here's how you actually do it."
              </p>
              <p>
                And fuckin' fair play to 'em! I <i>love</i> Ring Racers, I think
                it's fantastic. Driving is a joy in it, the drifting is absolute
                perfection and the ring management mechanic is sublime.
                Basically you collect rings on the track, up to a maximum of 20.
                Getting hit loses rings, like in a regular Sonic game, but you
                can also use them one-by-one to get a momentary boost of speed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Driving is momentum-based - it's hard to build speed, and the
                whole aim of the game is maintaining it. And that's pretty damn
                tricky! And with that in mind, maybe you hold on to your rings
                while you're ahead in case you scupper a corner and need to
                spend them to bring yourself back up to pace later!
              </p>
              <p>
                This turns every race into a fine balancing act. It pushes you
                to learn the track layouts and learn them well, evaluating where
                you can use rings, when you're gonna get more, whether you
                should diverge from the main route to go down a side road and
                grab a powerful item. Each track has multiple routes through it,
                like a classic 2D Sonic level (and SRB2's levels too, of
                course). Some are faster, some are slower, some are only
                accessible with certain items. Every lap ends up different as a
                result as you experiment. It's <i>joyous.</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                Then there's the trick system. The tutorial teaches you about
                it, and then the game proceeds not to use it for around 8 cups.
                But it's another element of this really elegant puzzle. Tricks
                can only be done on specific ramps and stage elements, and if
                performed correctly give a momentum boost in a specific
                direction. This can lead to new routes, to boost pads, to
                special secrets!
              </p>
              <p>
                It's a game that is packed to the gills with <i>stuff,</i> and
                it's bloody lovely.
              </p>
              <p>
                So yeah. Play Ring Racers. It's available on all PC platforms,
                with full controller support. The tutorial is famously long
                (around 40 minutes NO IT'S OK COME BACK) but it's worth
                persevering through, I promise. PLAY IT I LOVE IT!!
