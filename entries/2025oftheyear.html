                Like many trannies, I keep a media list on my bluesky every
                year. Here's a bit more details on my favourite things from this
                year.
              </p>
              <p>
                First up though, the complete list, sorted by type. This is a
                list of things that were new to me this year, so it's a mix of
                stuff from 2025 and the past. Everything on there is something I
                finished (or, in the case of video games, played long enough to
                feel like I'd got everything I wanted to out of it) - there's a
                number of half-finished series on my Jellyfin server that I ran
                out of steam on. Not everything on the list is good, but it was
                at least enjoyable enough to get to the end of, so please treat
                the entire list as some kind of endorsement.

                OK COOL. Big list. Donezo. Now it's time for TOP FIVES. First
                up: movies. TV and games will come later this week.
              </p>
              <h3>FILM</h3>
              <h4>5. The Descent</h4>
              <p>
                Horror movie with all woman cast from early 2000s: recipe for
                disaster, you'd think. But The Descent defies expectations in
                many many ways.It's excellent! I was lucky enough to see this in
                the cinema for a 20th anniversary screening. I feel like a lot
                of horror movies benefit the most from being seen in theatre,
                scares and spooks hit better on the big screen.
              </p>
              <p>
                And that is definitely true here! I was properly terrified
                throughout! The deep marks in my wife's hand can speak to that.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's interesting that this film was not specifically written to
                be all-women. I guess that makes sense - most of the characters
                have actual... personalities? Which for women in film of that
                era is super-unusual. In amongst the gore and scares there's
                messy, bitchy drama. There's a Chekhov's Necklace. There's
                themes of maternal otherness!!
              </p>
              <p>
                Which is to say, film's got a lot going on, and I was delighted
                to be surprised by how good it was.
              </p>
              <h4>4. Weapons</h4>
              <p>
                This year's Hottest Take Generator! Is it about school
                shootings? Is it about noncing? Should we call Yewtree?
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't know, honestly. But I don't think it really matters.
                Divorced from any Words about what it's About, it's
                fundamentally just an extremely well put-together thriller.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think the multiple-viewpoint structure works really well for
                it. It pulls the rug out from the viewer just as they're getting
                comfortable with each protagonist.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think it's fair to say a lot of horror films flub the final
                act. Weapons <i>almost</i> does, but by shifting into slapstick
                in that last ten minutes it swerves and kinda works? It's solid
                catharsis considering the tension the entire film has built up,
                and the slapstick itself is funny enough that the tone flies
                well. Great flick.
              </p>
              <h4>3. 28 Years Later</h4>
              <p>
                I described this movie on Bluesky as full of both Boyle's and
                Garland's worst excesses, and I stand by that. Yet
                <i>despite</i> that, the movie absolutely soars.
              </p>
              <p>
                28 Days Later was lightly allegorical for Britain's societal
                decay, Years pushes that to the fore far more than I expected. A
                stagnant little island, closing its borders and disallowing
                outside entry, for fear of those raping, pillaging monsters to
                discover this green and pleasant land. But enough about Brexit!
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm being facetious. But it's impossible not to draw these
                parallels, they're absolutely plain on the face of the movie.
                This is a film about Brexit, about the hideous racism that
                continues to erupt through Britain's skin. Boyle uses colonial
                propaganda to decorate the safe haven, he uses scalps and skulls
                claimed by teenagers - and teenage boys in specific, women
                relegated to servitude in this society - to demonstrate their
                entry to adulthood. To manhood.
              </p>
              <p>
                I find Erik's inclusion in the story fascinating. A direct
                demonstration of Europe plodding on just fine without Britain,
                our entire island left to rot in its own filth. Spike is
                fascinated by Erik's iPhone - a physical manifestation of the
                world carrying on with one less country on its map. History
                ended for Britain, but the rest of the world continued on.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Jimmy Saville thing was heavily commented on by incredulous
                cinemagoers just after its release, as if it was just shock
                value. But I feel it is the perfect thematic endpoint of the
                film - Spike is something new, someone interested in shaping the
                rubble of the old world into something resembling society. But
                society has moved on. We, the audience, know Jimmy Saville was a
                pedophile. But the model of Britain maintained by the film is
                fighting to remain. A hideous, noncing isolationist monster.
              </p>
              <p>Fuckin' phenomenal movie. Can't wait for the next one.</p>
              <h4>2. Summer Wars</h4>
              <p>
                Hey, you heard of this movie called 'Summer Wars?' Pretty
                fuckin' good I reckon! Pretty seminal!
              </p>
              <p>
                Being facetious, here, obviously. Recommending people watch
                'Summer Wars' is only really one notch away from saying 'you
                should watch Akira', it's not exactly a hidden gem. But it is
                <i>excellent.</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                I watched it twice this year, once at home, once at the cinema.
                It is so interesting to me how similar it is to the Digimon
                short 'Our War Game' (same creative team), just expanded to
                feature length. And rightly so, honestly, that one short is
                bursting with ideas that it feels like couldn't quite be
                executed to the degree they deserved within that envelope. It's
                nice when a creator gets a second crack at an idea.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hosoda's got an adaptation of Hamlet coming out next year, which
                I cannot wait for. And also leads me neatly on to...
              </p>
              <h4>1. Grand Theft Hamlet</h4>
              <p>Hey. Hey, you. Remember the COVID19 pandemic?</p>
              <p>
                Yes yes I know it's still going on etc etc but you are picking
                up what I'm putting down. The lockdowns and the accompanying
                isolation. Retreating into virtual worlds. The nuclear impact of
                Among Us and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
              </p>
              <p>
                What would a film about that actually <i>look</i> like, though?
              </p>
              <p>Hey. Hey you. Remember Grand Theft Auto V?</p>
              <p>
                It's weird to think about GTAV as a game that is still extant.
                That game came out when I was 20! I was still at university! I
                was literally a boy at that point!
              </p>
              <p>
                But it still exists. I've played quite a lot of it in the
                intervening 12 years, too, especially of GTA Online, a wholly
                different beast than the story mode that tentpoles the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's a whole subculture in GTA Online of roleplay servers,
                and unique gamemodes... grown men reliving GModRP from the 00s
                but on a much, much grander budget. It's even something Rockstar
                themselves support.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some roleplay they don't officially support, though? Acting. So
                what if you put on a performance of Shakespeare's Hamlet, right
                there in GTA Online. In a live server.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's the hook of Grand Theft Hamlet. But it's not really what
                the film is about.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's a film about isolation and loneliness. About the slow
                fractures that build in relationships. About depression and
                suicidal ideation. And, of course, about how you even go about
                staging a play in a game about blowing each other up.

                It's a really beautiful film that manages to capture 2020 in
                amber in a way I didn't really think was possible. I recommend
                everyone watch it. It was my high watermark for movies this year
                and nothing compared, in the end. A fantastic way to spend an
                hour and a half.
