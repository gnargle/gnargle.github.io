                <p>Time waits for noone.</p>
                <p>
                  It's a common refrain through Mamoru Hosoda's first original
                  film. (OK, it's not <i>strictly</i> original, being based on a
                  novel, but this helps distinguish it from the one piece film
                  and digimon short films he made beforehand). It's a phrase a
                  lot of the characters seem confused by. It's unclear if this
                  is because it's in English, or if it's because they're
                  teenagers and aren't really comfortable with the passage of
                  time yet. That's kind of the point, of course.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As The Girl Who Leapt Through Time ages, though, it has taken
                  on something of a different meaning. The film came out in
                  2006, when I was but 12 years old. The characters use gorgeous
                  <i>keitai</i> phones. Makoto, Chiaka and Kousuke play baseball
                  in the summer heat. Yuri and Koho harbour secret crushes in
                  the schoolyard. Crickets chirp in the evenings.
                </p>
                <p>It's nostalgic.</p>
                <p>
                  The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is the first anime I ever
                  watched that wasn't Pokemon, Digimon or Beyblade. I was 15,
                  going through a puberty I didn't want, in a brand new
                  relationship with a girl I liked a lot. We sat in her living
                  room and she showed me this film, this gorgeous, pale-hued
                  dream of a summer half the world away, the winter's bite
                  chased away by that haze on the screen. I fell in love
                  immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A lot of Hosoda's magic is taking a high-concept premise, but
                  then using it to find the magic in the mundane. Makoto is a
                  time traveller, but she's a daft one, using her leaps to eat a
                  pudding, to catch pitches, to avoid an awkward confession.
                  She's an everygirl, unburdened with responsibility, her whole
                  life ahead of her to try over and over again. She's everything
                  I wished I could be, then. I didn't know why I identified so
                  much with her. I guess I do now.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We broke up soon after. I still don't really know why - I was
                  probably too immature, or maybe she knew there was something
                  wrong with me that I wouldn't work out myself for another half
                  decade. But the film stuck with me, and every rewatch takes me
                  back to that winter evening. Our first kiss had only been a
                  few days prior - my very first - and I still wasn't sure how
                  to handle being a 'boyfriend.' I mean, I still don't, that's
                  why nowadays I'm a girlfriend. But Makoto's love resonated
                  through me like a tuning fork, that pure love that for a long
                  time you think can only happen on screen and in books. She
                  promises to come running for Chiaki, to find him through time
                  himself. I wondered what it felt like to know you'd chase
                  someone to the ends of the Earth like that.
                </p>
                <p>I'm lucky enough to know that love, now.</p>
                <p>
                  I always come out of a Hosoda film with a renewed appreciation
                  of the beauty of the world. They're beautiful stories, but
                  they're also films that obsess over both natural and man-made
                  majesty. The flowers and the bees. A tower of clouds. The
                  diffused sunlight through a classroom window. A level
                  crossing. It makes the world you live in feel so much more
                  bright.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There's a line, from The End of Evangelion, one that never
                  fails to make me cry. It's the same sentiment as this, this
                  reverence for the world around us, that we should take time,
                  every day, to truly <i>see</i> that beauty. "As long as there
                  is the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth... it'll all work out."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our world gets harder and harder to live in, every day. I
                  spend so much of my time worrying, whether it's over people I
                  love in America, terrorised by a regime that grows more
                  terrifying by the hour, or whether it's at home, living as I
                  am on TERF island. But works like this, art about normal
                  people just doing their best... It reminds me we can all do
                  that, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I feel honoured to have seen this film in the cinema. I often
                  feel like that, seeing films that I didn't or couldn't see in
                  theatres the first time around. I think the cinema is kind of
                  a sacred place, I guess. It makes a movie whole, complete.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Time waits for noone. So we should make the most of it while
                  we still can. To everyone out there who might need it - and
                  everyone who doesn't, too. I love you. It'll all work out.
                </p>
