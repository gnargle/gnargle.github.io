                  OK first things first can we have a nice round of applause for
                  the first anniversary of the blog! I'm a changeable beast so
                  it's actually quite impressive I have kept writing here.
                  Probably because I do genuinely find it quite easy. It's nice
                  to just write my thoughts somewhere at length. Here's to many
                  more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  OK SO IN 2025 I STARTED READING HOMESTUCK AND ON THE
                  SEVENTEENTH I FINISHED HOMESTUCK AND NOW I'M INSANE.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You've probably definitely heard of homestuck. The first
                  project Toby Fox worked on. The root of the trolls. Very,
                  very, <i>very</i> long webcomic.
                </p>
                <p>But did you know? It's actually really, extremely good.</p>
                <p>
                  The thing about homestuck which I did not know going in (and I
                  imagine is probably easy to miss!) is that calling it a
                  webcomic is very much selling homestuck short.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Homestuck is primarily a webcomic, for sure. The panels can be
                  kinda shitty and dumb. Or they can be absolutely stunning
                  works of art. I have multiple panels decorating my profile and
                  header pictures, watchface, and phone wallpaper. Many of those
                  panels are in fact animated gifs, with rudimentary but often
                  beautiful animation. Many of those panels are also accompanied
                  with extended dialogue from one or more characters, which are
                  captivating. Occasionally, a page is titled [S] something,
                  denoting that the page is in fact a flash animation. These
                  flash animations can be simple 2s loops, simple games, or,
                  sometimes, a multi-minute lovingly drawn animated sequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those flashes are also accompanied by music! Which is where
                  the Toby Fox connection comes in, but let's not get it
                  twisted, the number of artists who contributed to Homestuck is
                  very vast.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Homestuck is a mixed media project then, and in so being,
                  decides to play in the space of its form like, to be honest,
                  nothing I've ever seen before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Acts 1 through 5 are fairly straightforward - they definitely
                  have interesting elements (the game where John explores Lowas
                  and Alterniabound standout,as does Dave: Ascend, the first of
                  those multi-minute animations). The author, Andrew Hussie,
                  interrupts a few times to give a plot summary. Then, towards
                  the end of Act 5, the first of the big rug pulls really comes
                  out, with the theming of the website changing and the reveal
                  that Hussie's fourth-wall-breaking sections are actually
                  canonically in universe. Action begins to happen in the header
                  and footer images of the comic as well as the main panels.
                  Then [S] Cascade happens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I cannot <i>imagine</i> what it must have been like watching
                  Cascade at the time. In fact, just go and fucking watch it
                  yourself. It's
                  <a href="https://youtu.be/0Mldr4sSV4s?list=RD0Mldr4sSV4s">
                    here.</a
                  >
                  Do you see what happened there, one minute and twelve seconds
                  in? Where the dog thing casts 'Red Miles?'
                </p>
                <p>
                  The animation
                  <i>expands beyond the bounds of the panel,</i>growing to
                  swallow the page. You can completely understand why this comic
                  broke people's brains.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After this, it never stops. You get a bit of minorly
                  interactive fiction. At one point, the story takes place in
                  two parallel panels that sit next to each other. The layout
                  and theme of the pages will continue to change. [S] Game Over
                  fucks with the entire page throughout its runtime, changing
                  the theme of the page multiple times. Characters break out of
                  the panel and fight in the negative space. It's <i>insane.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  And that should be the sell to people who want to read it,
                  sure. 'Look how impressive it is. Look at how its play with
                  form will go on to influence Undertale and Deltarune, its
                  unarguable spiritual successors.' But backing all of that, is
                  some genuinely excellent character drama.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Homestuck has an absurdly large cast, especially by its
                  climax, but each is fun and interesting in their own way. Some
                  break out and form an archetype that multiple characters in
                  future things you witness will inherit. Some are sad sack dope
                  idiots but you love them anyway. Some are John's hot mom. It
                  is, again, no surprise that they imprinted themselves on the
                  comic's huge fanbase.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Which brings us to Vriska god damn Serket. The most important
                  character in all of Homestuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Vriska is one of the trolls who get introduced in act 5, and
                  also you definitely already know from seeing a convention
                  photo at least once in your life. She's <i>kind of</i> a
                  colossal asshole. I love her more than anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have imprinted on Vriska Serket like a lost puppy. In 3
                  months I have dyed my hair, got it cut in her style, bought
                  multiple outfits to match her, and even occasionally started
                  using her typing quirk. I am, I suppose, a Vriska kinnie.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is, undeniably, embarassing. But it also makes me happy!
                  I love what I look like at the minute! I love my new hair! I'm
                  wearing jeans for the first time in a decade and I feel damn
                  sexy doing so! Yes, it's silly, but life's too short to worry
                  about being cringe. So I'm embracing it! Because why the fuck
                  not!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've even started drawing. I'm shit but I love vriska so much
                  I want to keep drawing her and get better until I can make her
                  proud. You can keep up with that particular endeavour on
                  bluesky if you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Point is, homestuck's great. It's something of a modern
                  rosetta stone, too - since reading it, there have been so many
                  things that I have looked at and gone "that's from homestuck"
                  or "they worked on homestuck." Undertale and Deltarune are
                  absolutely bursting with references. The composer and director
                  on Unbeatable? Homestuck musician. Jamie Paige? HOMESTUCK
                  MUSICIAN. There are cathedrals everywhere, for those with the
                  eyes to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A lot of people will tell you that you shouldn't read
                  homestuck. It's archaic in some ways - the early acts have
                  some slurs and some insensitivity, which has naturally not
                  aged well. But it's still unlike anything else out there, and
                  has completely reconfigured my brain. I went into this reading
                  pursuing fandom archeology, and I've come out of it a
                  permanently changed woman. What a ride.
