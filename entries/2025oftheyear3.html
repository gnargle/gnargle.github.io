                Like many trannies, I keep a media list on my bluesky every
                year. Here's a bit more details on my favourite things from this
                year.
              </p>
              <p>
                The list is already in the FILMS post so I won't repeat it here.
                If you missed that one you can find it
                <a href="2025oftheyear.html">HERE.</a> OK. On with the show.
                Today's words are about TELEVISUAL SERIESES.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beforehand though - I want to note that this was maybe the
                hardest of these lists to put together. I struggled with a top 5
                of games really bad but it was even worse for TV - missing out
                both Severance S02 and What It Feels Like For A Girl feels
                CRUEL. The full list is on the first of these roundups, but some
                other standouts that aren't in the below list that I recommend
                you watch include Wayward, Detroiters and Black Mirror S07. OK,
                on with the show.
              </p>
              <h3>TV SHOWS</h3>
              <h4>5. Gen V (S02)</h4>
              <p>
                The Boys is a really good show. It came at just the right time,
                starting up just as Marvel fatigue was really setting in, and
                kind of hasn't let up since. The full tilt pivot into critique
                of the American right has kept it fresh, and every series
                manages to amp up the disgust-ometer, which is genuinely
                impressive when season 3 had an on-screen orgy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gen V is the 'College Spin-Off,' which had every chance of being
                basically rubbish. But series 1 was also great, introducing a
                lot of fantastic characters. I think the one thing about the
                Boys that is lacking is character archetypes - the titular Boys
                are kind of all cut from the same cloth, and everyone in Vought
                or the Seven are some kind of ubermensch sexual pervert. It
                works for the blunt instrument messaging, but it leaves a little
                to be desired elsewhere, which is probably why Frenchie and
                Kimiko stand out so much.
              </p>
              <p>
                But Gen V focuses the lens on character drama (while still
                finding time for a bombastic action plot). And I think with
                series 2, it's ended up elevating itself from the series it span
                off from!
              </p>
              <p>
                College is always a good setting for these kinds of things
                (there are like 50 american pie movies after all) and I am a bit
                of a sucker for teenage melodrama. So it all works really well
                on me.
              </p>
              <p>
                And! It seems like it's wrapped up now! I admire that, too. Get
                in, 2 seasons, get out, wrap up the story with The Boys S05.
                Lovely. Manageable. Highly recommended.
              </p>
              <h4>4. Long Story Short</h4>
              <p>
                After Bojack Horseman ended, everyone who watched 7 years of
                Bojack Horseman said 'Well, what are the Bojack Horseman team
                gonna do now?'
              </p>
              <p>
                The answer, apparently, is continue making you cry [laughing].
              </p>
              <p>
                Bojack is kind of an impossible act to follow. It's one of the
                funniest animated shows of all time, up there with golden age
                Simpsons. Like that vaunted era too, it's heartful and
                gut-punching. It's a genuine work of genius.
              </p>
              <p>
                Long Story Short isn't quite that good. Yet. But it comes
                <i>absurdly</i> close.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are moments throughout this series that will hit very hard
                for queer people, for ethnic minorities, and, of course, for
                jewish folk, which is the core makeup of the family at its
                centre.
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't think I can really do it justice here. Please, just go
                watch it. It's like 8 episodes of 20 minutes each, it's very
                short, it's so well put together, it's mind-boggling. Lovely
                series.
              </p>
              <h4>3. The Chair Company</h4>
              <p>
                'What if Twin Peaks was made by the I Think You Should Leave
                guys?' isn't something that should work. And yet. AND. YET.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every scene in this show is cinematic maximalism. It jerks from
                absurdist hype-comedy to intense, creeping horror-drama at a
                pace previously thought impossible. It genuinely boggles the
                mind. You can be in tears laughing at a bit one second and then
                the very next have abject terror struck into your heart.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will say there's not much more I can say here, it is a show
                that kind of defies description? It's a tough recommend because
                unless you're already bought into the ITYSL/Detroiters style
                this isn't gonna do much to persuade you, despite also having a
                compelling mystery. Give those shows a go first, and if you like
                them, try this out too. Can't wait to see what season 2 has in
                store. RBMC better watch out.
              </p>
              <h4>2. The Rehearsal</h4>
              <p>If you're in here, you're normal.</p>
              <p>
                Nathan Fielder's continued exploration of human psyche bears
                greater fruit than ever before. I like The Rehearsal a lot -
                Nathan For You is really, really funny, but outside of Finding
                Frances it doesn't have a whole lot to say.
              </p>
              <p>
                But The Rehearsal really does, while maintaining that comedy.
                Season 1 was a really interesting scope in on what it means to
                be a parent, the terror that accompanies it, and the weight one
                mistake can have on that responsibility. Season 2 is about
                something else, which I am going to cut under the end of the
                list to avoid spoilers. But suffice to say it had me thinking a
                lot about myself in a way that nothing else this year really
                did. Excellent television. Probably would have been number one,
                if it wasn't for the late entry of...
              </p>
              <h4>1. PLURIBUS</h4>
              <p>
                I mean, duh doy. New Vince Gilligan show with Rhea Seehorn in
                the principal role was always gonna sweep.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're unfamiliar, Vince Gilligan is the creator and
                showrunner of both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, with
                Seehorn playing the deuteragonist in the latter show. BrBa and
                BCS are, of course, well cited as some of the best TV ever made,
                and you're not gonna find a dissenting opinion on that from me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gilligan's shows are masterfully tense stories and Pluribus is
                no different, this time swapping the hard-boiled criminal
                underworld with science fiction, which he'd previously dabbled
                with as an X-Files staff writer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pluribus is most impressive for doing so much with what you
                could call 'so little' (despite the oftentimes large scale of
                the project). While the standout moments of Pluribus are the
                impeccably choreographed actions of the Others, the real joy of
                the show is picking apart and interpreting meaning of its
                smallest moments - the choices the Others make, the
                peculiarities of their speech, each acting as a tiny clue to a
                larger mystery.
              </p>
              <p>
                A mystery that, realistically, is mostly solved. Unlike
                Severance, AppleTV's other big scifi mystery story, Pluribus
                isn't particualrly interested in holding its cards that close to
                its chest. The Others are joined together by a radio frequency
                and are following a biological imperative to spread that joining
                to more people, both terrestrially and beyond the stars.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of those details are laid out early on, some in small
                details in scenes, some plainly in dialogue. Instead, Pluribus
                focuses its attention away from any mystery and towards Carol,
                the loneliest woman on Earth.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've seen the show described as slow as a result, and I'll be
                honest: I think it's a worthless critique. Not to 'back in my
                day' but a show taking time to firmly establish a character,
                their life and motivations, used to be considered very good
                writing. Hell, Breaking Bad does this! While the first episode
                is a lot ofbombast (like Pluribus), the following few episodes
                are much more slow and considered. I think it's easy to forget
                that the unbearable tension that permeated much of that shows
                latter half was only made possible by being slowly ratcheted
                throughout. Pluribus's first season is that ratcheting, the
                establishment of a ticking clock that will end in Carol getting
                joined if she can't stop it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Season 1 sets the table. after that, that's when the fun begins.
              </p>
              <p>
                Which is of course not to say this show is anything less than
                stellar in this series. It's perfect filmmaking. Photography
                that puts everything else on screen to shame. Small touches laid
                in wait to pay off later, my favourite being the gravestone
                Carol lays for her wife in episode 2, the inscription on which
                is not shown until the final episode - when Carol has moved on
                from the grief.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're not watching Pluribus, you should be. This is my top
                recommendation on this list for a reason. It's a masterwork.
                Can't wait to see where it goes.
              </p>

              <h4>HERE BE THE REHEARSAL SPOILERS</h4>
              <br />
              <p>
                OK, so The Rehearsal season 2 is about neurodivergence in the
                airline industry, specifically in respect to autism. Early on in
                the series, Nathan pulls up the airline pilot subreddit, where
                he sees many people talking about their autism and how you
                should <i>never</i> get a formal diagnosis, as it will require
                you to disclose it to the aviation authority and could lead to
                you losing your license.
              </p>
              <p>
                As is probably obvious, the kind of people predisposed to
                wanting to fly a plane are also the kind of people to be pretty
                autistic. But the FAA guidelines on neurodiversity are so
                woefully outdated that autism is considered a flight risk, and
                so getting a formal diagnosis can lead to pilots being stripped
                of their ranks. For many pilots this would also mean a loss of
                livelihood.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nathan himself begins to question his own neurology. Anyone
                paying attention to Fielder's previous works will have noted
                very autistic overtones in much of the 'Nathan' character (how
                much of that is acting and how much is his real personality is,
                much like the rest of the persona, is very much up for debate).
                In one episode, he takes an autism diagnosis test, with many of
                the questions he has to answer shown on screen. I found it very
                challenging to answer these questions 'correctly,' which is to
                say, to know which of the answers indicated neurotypicality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Long time readers will have probably cottoned on to my own
                autism. It's not something I've directly talked about on this
                blog, but it's pretty evident in a number of the posts - and if
                you're a bluesky follower you'll have seen I talk about it every
                now and again.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm not formally diagnosed. I don't really want to go through
                that process. There's no real benefit to doing so, it would be a
                piece of paper certifying that I am indeed the great autismo.
                Unlike ADHD and other neurodivergences, there's no medication
                that can relieve any symptoms here. But I've still felt
                <i>guilty</i> about not doing so. Like by not being formally
                diagnosed, I'm <i>not really autistic.</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                This series made me reevaluate that perspective. It was really
                useful in knowing I'm not alone in reticence to be diagnosed. In
                the past, taking 'sample' diagnosis tests has upset me
                (including one for ADHD, which. maybe i should get tested for
                that one. I like the zoomzoom drugs), and knowing that there are
                other people out there who don't want to have that piece of
                paper was reassuring.
              </p>
              <p>
                That includes Nathan himself, who, after taking the test,
                refuses to pick up the results before going on to perform The
                Miracle Over The Mojave.
