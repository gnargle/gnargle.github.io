                  Huddled under a railway arch in Vauxhall, there's a wormhole
                  to the 22nd century. It's like nothing else.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Earlier this year, shortly after surgery and during MCM May,
                  Cat and I visited
                  <a href="https://bridgecommand.space/">Bridge Command</a> for
                  the first time. It's an experience that's hard to really
                  describe - part video game, part LARP, part interactive
                  theatre, part escape room, it offers an experience like
                  nothing I've seen before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You may have seen the
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UROMioNwoXs"
                    >People Make Games video</a
                  >
                  on Bridge Command already. It's a great video and offers a
                  pretty complete idea of what an average Bridge Command
                  'performance' entails, which is some kind of mix of chaos,
                  drama and lore. If you do well, you get promotions or
                  commendations, if you do badly... well, you don't. But
                  whatever happens you get a pretty unique experience!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Obviously, there's a bit of a thumb on the scale - the cast
                  and ops know that players are going to have a better time if
                  they're successful after facing an appropriate challenge, so
                  missions are adjusted dynamically to give players the best
                  experience. It <i>is</i> possible to fail missions, so I'm
                  told, but I've yet to experience it myself. What does seem to
                  happen more often is a 'partial success,' especially in
                  mission types that aren't pure combat. You might succeed in
                  delivering your cargo, but didn't solve the puzzle the actor
                  handed you early on, so you didn't get a full resolution to
                  the story. Or maybe you negotiated with pirates, but blew up
                  one of their friends on the way to the summit, so the terms
                  didn't end up in your favour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These RPG inspired quasi-successes work really well as hooks
                  to bring you back! Something Cat, Aris and I encountered in
                  one of our missions was so surprising and expanded the world
                  so far beyond what had previously been established and it only
                  made the claws dig in deeper.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The actors help sell this, of course. Each actor plays a named
                  person within the UCS, which is their 'canon' character, whose
                  achievements, rank and role change regularly. There are
                  engineers, ace pilots, captains and commanders and plenty
                  more, and you'll usually interact with two on your mission -
                  one who trains your group on how to operate the ship, and one
                  who acts as your flight commander, giving you mission updates
                  from the Warspite. Then while on mission, you'll often run
                  into further characters, all played by these same actors (else
                  the cast would be enormous). It's clearly a job that requires
                  a <i>lot</i> of its cast, with them having to change role
                  multiple times a day and put in convincing performances for
                  each, often requiring physical acting. On one mission we
                  rescued a man who had been running out of oxygen on a space
                  station. As they collapsed into the ship from the airlock,
                  suddenly I wasn't looking at an actor, but someone who needed
                  help, and I forgot where I was and helped them limp into the
                  bridge. A really magical performance.

                <p>
                  But that's all just the normal missions, ones you can go to
                  any day of the week (except Mondays). I'm here to talk about
                  the <b>Special Event</b> we attended last weekend.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bridge Command itself is made up of two different ships and a
                  bar which, in-universe, is the Destroyer-class UCS Warspite
                  that the two smaller ships (the UCS Havock and Takanami)
                  despatch from. When you book on normally, you're put on one of
                  the ships for an hour and a half or so and have some time in
                  the bar before and after. But the special events are
                  different. You're part of one <i>huge</i> crew, a full crew of
                  both ships <i>and</i> a reserve pair of crews who alternate on
                  to the ships every half hour or so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While on the ship, you're in what is mostly a regular mission,
                  albeit longer and (usually) with higher stakes. While on the
                  Warspite, you're in a LARP, talking to the characters and
                  making plans that you and all the other teams will enact
                  throughout the evening. These events are much longer than a
                  normal session - around four hours - and have the space to
                  tell a grander story.
                </p>

                  Some spoilers for Operation Daedalus follow. If you plan on
                  attending a rerun of this event, please do not read further.

                  The one we attended was a rerun of one from September, and
                  there's talk of another run of it - so I won't spoil exactly
                  what happened. However, there was a moment in our performance
                  that has now become canon and shared with the wider community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout the event, while we were on the Warspite, there was
                  a lot of talk about Lieutenant Commander Furlong being
                  missing. Furlong had been a mainstay of the Warspite - many
                  people there had struck up friendships with the character and
                  shared real moments with him. As the evening went on, more and
                  more fear crept into the Warspite staff. Captain Hamilton, who
                  was in direct command of Furlong, chased for information about
                  him from anyone who they could grab. Lt. Kihu, after getting
                  news her friend (or something more) who'd been stationed on
                  the UCS Khopesh, was safe, broke down in tears. But still, no
                  word of Furlong.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The evening hit its climax. A suicide mission, with someone
                  holding the Dead Man's Switch. I was proud to be captaining
                  the Havock as we reached that peak, as we did a Pacific Rim,
                  with evacuees from the Warspite on my bridge. Our hull is
                  totalled, we're outgunned, and everything is compeltely fried.
                  The power cuts. And we're back, fully repaired, docked to the
                  Warspite. Everyone crowds back to the Mess.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The person on that Dead Man's Switch is still alive. People
                  are confused, there's plenty of chaos. Then it all quietens as
                  in from the ship bay stumbles Furlong. He gets carted off to
                  the medbay. We deliver a report to the Captain. As it winds
                  up... the news everyone's been dreading.
                </p>
                <p>Thrice the lethal dose of radiation. He's gone.</p>
                <p>
                  There's a beat. The room is silent. And then one of the crew
                  members starts to sing. A memorial song.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm not ashamed to say it brought me to tears. By the end, the
                  whole crew was singing the chorus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every time I've been to Bridge Command, I've come away
                  jonesing for more. The special event was that, times ten.
                  We're already booked in for the end of the month for some
                  spooky halloween missions. I am sure both will cling to me as
                  much as this event did. If you're in the UK, I highly
                  recommend you make the trip to London to visit. It's like
                  nothing else out there in the great wide cosmos.
                </p>
                <p>Here's to you, Furlong. For those who've gone beyond.</p>
