But now that spaces are for everyone, including kids, those rough edges are gone. You\u0027re extremely unlikely to stumble upon someone writing about the hentai comics of Sonic the Hedgehog unless you\u0027re specifically looking for it. Adult only spaces have been stripped away, smoothed off and siloed into very specific places. Pornhub, Xtube... I know these names better than I know my own grandmother\u0027s."

      "text": "Flash games evoke nostalgia in basically everyone who grew up in the 00s. For many it was Newgrounds or CoolMathGames, but for me, it was funnyjunk. Funnyjunk was a content aggregator - it\u0027s where I first saw a bunch of weebl\u0027s stuff cartoons, blode, strongbad. It also linked out to a few other flash collection websites, one was a site that collected hundreds of flash games. Sadly, the name escapes me now."

      "text": "And look. Politically, yes, hentai games of old are pretty het too. Being \u0027rewarded\u0027 with sex for basic video game chores is terribly objectifying. But the modern hardware and lack of limitations on what people are able to make means the games feel more het, more cookie cutter. Not to \u0027back in my day,\u0027 but like everything else made in flash, hentai games had real personality. You could track a creator\u0027s works and lineage - Z0ne is probably the most well-known example of this, but they\u0027re far from the only one. Mittsies is out there making full-ass video games like Helltaker and Awaria now, which are excellent, and they got their start making MLP porn games, many of which had some pretty extreme kinks in them. Game recognise game, Mittsie."

Why do they work, why do they titillate? What is it about porn games that buzzes a certain subsection of brains just right? We may even find out something about ourselves along the way."

      "text": "Cool. OK, some housekeeping. First of all, cards on the table, I\u0027ve dabbled in this field before. Long ago I made a game called Ace Attorney: The Dark Age of Love for a porn game jam run by other noted lover of porn games, eevee. (She\u0027s making her own game, fox flux, which is porny if you\u0027re weird with it! For any hets reading this don\u0027t worry about it). It actually ended up getting featured on Kotaku UK, then later, the mothership itself. It\u0027s not good, by any stretch, but I did make it to impress my now-wife, so it did what it needed to do, and it has over 14,000 downloads on Itch.io. It\u0027s probably the most statistically significant thing I will ever do as a creative, which is weird to think about. But the point is, I contributed to the scene as well as consumed, and I feel pretty cool about that, honestly."

      "text": "Secondly: how do we play these games nowadays? Flash is long-dead, after all. Well. That, my friend, is where Flashpoint comes in. Essentially Archive.Org for flash games, applets, headers and so much more, it is an astonishing project that really doesn\u0027t get the recognition it deserves. Flashpoint provides a launcher, a packaged version of flash player that works on modern hardware, ruffle (a flash emulator) for the games that support it, and an exhaustive list of almost every flash Thing you could possibly imagine, all in one convenient package. 18\u002B flashes are excluded from the search by default, so we\u0027ll be toggling them on in the config if you want to play along at home."

      "text": "Thirdly: These games are all products of their time, and may contain content that some may not prefer to see. I will be operating to some extent under a [Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings] structure, where most things will not be content-warned. I will, however, make exceptions for things we may stumble across that include racism, homophobia, or other things that fall under the category of hate speech. I do not expect to see much of this, but there will likely be racist caricatures from time to time. Additionally, any particularly extreme kinks will be warned for; e.g. incest, lolisho, scat, etc. Any screenshots containing warned kinks will not be shown in-line and will only be text-linked. Everything else is fair game and will be shown in-line, so don\u0027t read these entries at work!"
