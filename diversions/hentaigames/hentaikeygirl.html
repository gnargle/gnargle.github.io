                OK, this is a fantastic place to start. If you have any history
                with these kinds of games, you probably recognise the name Z0ne,
                if not this flash itself. This was a 'game' (more of a
                controllable animation sequence, really) from Hentaikey, the
                premium source of hentai animations online in the 00s and early
                10s. They are, somehow, still kicking, despite rule34 and
                similar booru sites eating their lunch.
              </p>
              <p>
                Z0ne themself is an extremely prolific porn animation creator.
                Filtering to them in Flashpoint gives 117 results, and
                <a href="www.zone-archive.com">Z0ne Archive</a> has a blog post
                as recent as 2023. If you delve deeper they appear to be
                maintaining a fansly for a robot OC that was posted to
                yesterday! I'm glad they're still making cool stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even if this was never your scene, you've probably seen z0ne's
                art somewhere or other. They're very good at recreating the
                style of official animations, so in many cases their work looks
                like it could have come out of the original studio itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                This particular animation is one of the earliest I could find
                for z0ne, predating the introduction of z0netan, their OC/ident.
                There's a couple of 2005 animations from them listed on
                Flashpoint, and two 'Hentairella' games that don't have a
                copyright in them and look to be from when they were just
                starting out.
              </p>
              <p>
                So what's the game like? Well, it's an animation loop of a
                titjob, or 'paizuri' if you're cultured, featuring the Hentaikey
                mascot girl.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's not particularly in-depth or even very long, but it does
                generate a template that we will see a lot in future games we
                cover. First of all, there's the act list - each of these is a
                different animation loop of Miss Hentaikey performing the listed
                action on a strangely yellow penis.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the top right is something we will see in many, many
                animations and games going forward: the 'pleasure' score, here
                listed as a percentage. Strangely enough, this percentage can
                actually go negative, seemingly forever, if you sit on the
                'stop' option in the list for long enough. Each act continually
                raises the pleasure meter at different rates, with it raising
                faster the further south down the list you go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hit 100% pleasure and the action list is replaced with
                <b>CUM</b> and <b>STOP</b>. They do what you'd expect,
                <b>CUM</b> shows a finale animation where Miss Hentaikey gets a
                pretty intense facial. Stop just resets the game to 0% pleasure.
              </p>
              <p>
                And that's about all there is to it! Humble beginnings, but a
                degree of gamification that we'll see greatly expanded upon in
                future flashes from z0ne and indeed others.
              </p>
              <p>
                is it particularly titillating? Not for me, in this instance.
                There's no foreplay here, and titjobs don't really do it for me.
                The juice ain't worth the squeeze on 'em. The art is excellent
                though, and the animation is both gorgeous and seamlessly loops,
                which is definitely not always the case.
              </p>
              <p>
                This does start a trend of z0ne games having BANGERS as the
                soundtrack, mind. The piece in this is only a short loop (maybe
                a minute?) but it's a jazzy funk and honestly it slaps. There
                are no credits on this flash outside of the initial z0ne and
                hentaikey idents, and trying to Shazam the music proved
                fruitless, so all I can conclude is that z0ne composed this
                themselves. It rocks.
              </p>
              <p>
                And there we go! First entry, in the bag. Not the most in-depth
                piece of game design here, but we'll get there, promise. We
                gotta start with the small stuff first.
