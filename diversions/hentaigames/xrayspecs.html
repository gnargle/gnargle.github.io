                  The world was a simpler place pre-9/11. All one needed to
                  enjoy one's self was a flash to pose the question: what if you
                  had x-ray specs? Wouldn't it be great to see a titty without
                  having to take any clothes off?
                </p>
                <p>
                  There's not much to this 'game,' if you can even call it that.
                  You take the glasses from the extremely racist traveller
                  stereotype and use your cursor to reveal BOOBIES and WILLIES
                  and MINGE. Then you reach the end of the 4 or so screens,
                  float your cursor over the traveller's own scrote, and get
                  stabbed. Game over.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The masking is pretty clever. Not sure if early flash was
                  capable of simple mask blending or if this is some clever hack
                  the developer put together. Probably the former, really.

                  2001 isn't all sunshine and roses, though. The racism is
                  aforementioned. There's also some textbook fatphobia (because
                  who would <i>ever</i> want to look at a fat person naked, am I
                  right lads????) and of course, the requisite trans stereotype
                  (oh my god, a woman, but she's bald under the wig and has a
                  dick! Scandal! She has my number). It's hard to get mad at -
                  this was probably made by a 13 year old boy trying to be edgy
                  - but it is a useful time capsule of how far we've come in
                  general acceptance of marginalised groups? The nearest
                  neighbour for flash hentai now is artists posting their 18+
                  drawings on bluesky and in those circles you're likely to find
                  some absolutely scrumptious portrayals of trans people, fat
                  people, people of colour, et al. Porn is no longer a scene for
                  boys and boys alone, and the world is better for it.
