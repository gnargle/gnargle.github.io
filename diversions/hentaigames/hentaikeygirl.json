If you have any history with these kinds of games, you probably recognise the name Z0ne, if not this flash itself. This was a \u0027game\u0027 (more of a controllable animation sequence, really) from Hentaikey, the premium source of hentai animations online in the 00s and early 10s. They are, somehow, still kicking, despite rule34 and similar booru sites eating their lunch."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Z0ne themself is an extremely prolific porn animation creator. Filtering to them in Flashpoint gives 117 results, and Z0ne Archive has a blog post as recent as 2023. If you delve deeper they appear to be maintaining a fansly for a robot OC that was posted to yesterday! I\u0027m glad they\u0027re still making cool stuff."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Even if this was never your scene, you\u0027ve probably seen z0ne\u0027s art somewhere or other. They\u0027re very good at recreating the style of official animations, so in many cases their work looks like it could have come out of the original studio itself."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"This particular animation is one of the earliest I could find for z0ne, predating the introduction of z0netan, their OC/ident. There\u0027s a couple of 2005 animations from them listed on Flashpoint, and two \u0027Hentairella\u0027 games that don\u0027t have a copyright in them and look to be from when they were just starting out."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"So what\u0027s the game like? Well, it\u0027s an animation loop of a titjob, or \u0027paizuri\u0027 if you\u0027re cultured, featuring the Hentaikey mascot girl."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"It\u0027s not particularly in-depth or even very long, but it does generate a template that we will see a lot in future games we cover. First of all, there\u0027s the act list - each of these is a different animation loop of Miss Hentaikey performing the listed action on a strangely yellow penis."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In the top right is something we will see in many, many animations and games going forward: the \u0027pleasure\u0027 score, here listed as a percentage. Strangely enough, this percentage can actually go negative, seemingly forever, if you sit on the \u0027stop\u0027 option in the list for long enough. Each act continually raises the pleasure meter at different rates, with it raising faster the further south down the list you go."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Hit 100% pleasure and the action list is replaced with CUM and STOP. They do what you\u0027d expect, CUM shows a finale animation where Miss Hentaikey gets a pretty intense facial. Stop just resets the game to 0% pleasure."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"And that\u0027s about all there is to it! Humble beginnings, but a degree of gamification that we\u0027ll see greatly expanded upon in future flashes from z0ne and indeed others."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"is it particularly titillating? Not for me, in this instance. There\u0027s no foreplay here, and titjobs don\u0027t really do it for me. The juice ain\u0027t worth the squeeze on \u0027em. The art is excellent though, and the animation is both gorgeous and seamlessly loops, which is definitely not always the case."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"This does start a trend of z0ne games having BANGERS as the soundtrack, mind. The piece in this is only a short loop (maybe a minute?) but it\u0027s a jazzy funk and honestly it slaps. There are no credits on this flash outside of the initial z0ne and hentaikey idents, and trying to Shazam the music proved fruitless, so all I can conclude is that z0ne composed this themselves. It rocks."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"And there we go! First entry, in the bag. Not the most in-depth piece of game design here, but we\u0027ll get there, promise. We gotta start with the small stuff first."}]}
