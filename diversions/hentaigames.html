                Once upon a time, I was a horny teenage boy. Now, I'm a horny
                adult woman.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also (as is probably obvious from a bunch o0f other pages on
                this blog) grew up in the golden age of the internet, when the
                whole thing was new and exciting. A decentralised wonderland,
                where you could find anything and everything.
              </p>
              <p>
                Which, obviously, meant there was a <i>lot</i> of porn on it.
                The internet today is safe and sanitary, which. Like. OK. Yes,
                it's safer for kids. But now that spaces are for
                <i>everyone,</i> including kids, those rough edges are gone.
                You're extremely unlikely to stumble upon someone writing about
                <a href="../entries/srb2.html"
                  >the hentai comics of Sonic the Hedgehog</a
                >
                unless you're specifically looking for it. Adult only spaces
                have been stripped away, smoothed off and siloed into very
                specific places. Pornhub, Xtube... I know these names better
                than I know my own grandmother's.
              </p>
              <p>
                Back in the day though, porn was everywhere. As detailed
                previously, my first experience of pornography was on Sonic
                Cult, but shortly after that, I discovered hentai flash games.
                By accident, in fact.
              </p>
              <p>
                Flash games evoke nostalgia in basically everyone who grew up in
                the 00s. For many it was Newgrounds or CoolMathGames, but for
                me, it was funnyjunk. Funnyjunk was a content aggregator - it's
                where I first saw a bunch of weebl's stuff cartoons, blode,
                strongbad. It also linked out to a few other flash collection
                websites, one was a site that collected hundreds of flash games.
                Sadly, the name escapes me now.
              </p>
              <p>
                I played a lot of (relatively) tame stuff on that site! It was
                all nicked from newgrounds or armorgames or whatever, but I had
                a lot of fun hitting 'random' and finding Interactive Buddy,
                Bowman 2, that penguin clubbing game, you know. But also plenty
                of rougher stuff!
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyway, one day I hit random and came across a game called
                Frank's Adventure - a top down lite RPG. I gave it a go, as I
                always did, without really reading the instructions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Played through, ran around the world, played the skiing minigame
                that Tye from Digimon offered you. After a bit of effort, I beat
                the game, and got presented with this screen:
              </p>
              <a href="../img/diversions/hentaigames/franksadventure1.png">
                <img
                  class="blog-img-lrg"
                  src="../img/diversions/hentaigames/franksadventure1.png"
                  alt="A hentai image of a woman with red hair, spreadeagled on a bed facing away from the viewer. You can see her pussy and a tity"
                />
              </a>
              <p>
                THAT'S A FUCKIN TITY. TITY? IN VIDEO GAME? I'M THIRTEEN YEARS
                OLD THAT'S TWO OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS IN ONE!
              </p>
              <p>
                Now look. I'm not gonna pretend the art in this game is the best
                hentai in the world. This is another of the 'pics' you get, and
                other than looking a bit like Aerith it's pretty poor. Look at
                the rendering on that pussy. Poor show.
              </p>
              <a href="../img/diversions/hentaigames/franksadventure2.png">
                <img
                  class="blog-img-lrg"
                  src="../img/diversions/hentaigames/franksadventure2.png"
                  alt="A hentai image of a woman with brown hair who looks a bit like Aerith, facing the viewer and spreading her legs. She is fully nude."
                />
              </a>
              <p>
                But this experience flipped a switch in my brain. The idea of
                being able to play video games and get rewarded for succeeding
                with a titty was insanely enticing for me, a cumbrained idiot.
                So I spent an <i>insane</i> amount of time searching out 'free
                online sex games.'
              </p>
              <p>
                And with the aforementioned era of the internet, there was
                absolutely no shortage of them! Which was <i>great</i> for me as
                a horny teenager. But, sadly, this entire genre is disappearing,
                at least in any kind of properly creative sense.
              </p>
              <p>
                Plenty of porn games still exist, but by and large they have a
                decidedly different oeuvre than their heyday of the early
                internet. They're on steam and itch now, which is cool, but if I
                bring up the top selling adult games, well, the list looks like
                this:
              </p>
              <a href="../img/diversions/steamadultgames.png">
                <img
                  class="blog-img-lrg"
                  src="../img/diversions/steamadultgames.png"
                  alt="A screenshot of the Top Selling category on steam's Adult Only listings page. All of the games are Source Filmmaker-esque 'sex sims,' apart from the top hit, which is a furry FNAF porn parody."
                />
              </a>
              <p>
                There's only one way to describe this: extremely fuckin' hetty.
                Apart from that top result, which is some kind of FNAF porn
                parody thing. Aside: furries fucking rule and they deserve the
                world.
              </p>
              <p>
                And look. Politically, yes, hentai games of old are pretty het
                too. Being 'rewarded' with sex for basic video game chores is
                terribly objectifying. But the modern hardware and lack of
                limitations on what people are able to make means the games
                <i>feel</i> more het, more cookie cutter. Not to 'back in my
                day,' but like everything else made in flash, hentai games had
                real personality. You could track a creator's works and lineage
                - Z0ne is probably the most well-known example of this, but
                they're far from the only one. Mittsies is out there making
                full-ass video games like Helltaker and Awaria now, which are
                excellent, and they got their start making MLP porn games, many
                of which had some pretty extreme kinks in them. Game recognise
                game, Mittsie.
              </p>
              <p>
                So why am I writing this? Well, in short, I want to chronicle
                some of these games. Revisit some favourites, if you will. Maybe
                even do some analysis! Why do they work, why do they titillate?
                What is it about porn games that buzzes a certain subsection of
                brains just right? We may even find out something about
                ourselves along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                This will be an ongoing project, with this post being the
                kickoff. I will be updating irregularly. I don't promise to
                complete every game (some are huge undertakings!) but I will
                play for at least half an hour or so to get some reasonable
                impressions of each game.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cool. OK, some housekeeping. <b>First of all</b>, cards on the
                table, I've dabbled in this field before. Long ago I made a game
                called
                <a
                  href="https://gnargle.itch.io/ace-attorney-the-dark-age-of-love"
                  >Ace Attorney: The Dark Age of Love</a
                >
                for a porn game jam run by other noted lover of porn games,
                eevee. (She's making her own game,
                <a href="https://eevee.itch.io/fox-flux-deluxe">fox flux</a>,
                which is porny if you're weird with it! For any hets reading
                this don't worry about it). It actually ended up getting
                featured on
                <a
                  href="https://kotaku.com/sex-soaked-ace-attorney-fan-game-gives-a-whole-new-mean-1828522714"
                  >Kotaku UK, then later, the mothership itself.</a
                >
                It's not good, by any stretch, but I did make it to impress my
                now-wife, so it did what it needed to do, and it has over 14,000
                downloads on Itch.io. It's probably the most statistically
                significant thing I will ever do as a creative, which is weird
                to think about. But the point is, I contributed to the scene as
                well as consumed, and I feel pretty cool about that, honestly.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Secondly:</b> how do we play these games nowadays? Flash is
                long-dead, after all. Well. That, my friend, is where
                <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/">Flashpoint</a> comes
                in. Essentially Archive.Org for flash games, applets, headers
                and so much more, it is an astonishing project that really
                doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Flashpoint provides a
                launcher, a packaged version of flash player that works on
                modern hardware, ruffle (a flash emulator) for the games that
                support it, and an exhaustive list of almost every flash Thing
                you could possibly imagine, all in one convenient package. 18+
                flashes are excluded from the search by default, so we'll be
                toggling them on in the config if you want to play along at
                home.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Thirdly:</b> These games are all products of their time, and
                may contain content that some may not prefer to see. I will be
                operating to some extent under a [Creator Chose Not To Use
                Archive Warnings] structure, where most things will not be
                content-warned. I will, however, make exceptions for things we
                may stumble across that include racism, homophobia, or other
                things that fall under the category of hate speech. I do not
                expect to see much of this, but there will likely be racist
                caricatures from time to time. Additionally, any particularly
                extreme kinks will be warned for; e.g. incest, lolisho, scat,
                etc. Any screenshots containing warned kinks will not be shown
                in-line and will only be text-linked. Everything else is fair
                game and will be shown in-line, so don't read these entries at
                work!
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Finally,</b> this is a bit out of the realm of probably
                expected posts for this blog, so entries in this diversion will
                not be listed on the main RSS feed. I will be maintaining a
                separate one (linked at the top) that you can subscribe to if
                you want to know when I make a new post in this series.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cool, with all that said, expect the first post sometime this
                week! I dunno what it'll be on. Maybe I'll let Flashpoint RNG
                us. See you then!
