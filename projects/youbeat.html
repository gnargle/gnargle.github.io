                A while ago, I wanted to adapt arcade game Jubeat for home play,
                using a device called a launchpad. So I bought one. It looks
                like this:

              <p>
                Jubeat is a rhythm arcade game by Konami in their Bemani line.
                It looks like this:
              </p>
              <a href="../img/projects/jubeat.png">
                <img
                  class="blog-img"
                  src="../img/projects/jubeat.png"
                  alt="a
              product photo of the konami's jubeat arcade cabinet. It's a
              big box with speakers, a small wide screen, and a 4x4 grid of large buttons."
                />
              </a>
              <p>
                The grid of buttons are each separate note inputs, and the
                screen above it actually extends below the buttons. The notes
                for the beatmaps are shown beneath each button you need to
                press. it looks pretty cool, but naturally it's hard to play at
                home (ignoring that it's 'illegal' to play at home because
                piracy, but like, who gives a fuck on that front).
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, with a bit of RGB magic, you can kinda get an approximation
                of the inputs for Jubeat on a launchpad. So... why not do that?
              </p>
              <p>
                Thing is, it ended up pretty involved. Like projects tend to do.
                First port of call was talking to the launchpad from my language
                of choice, C#. The launchpad is controlled over MIDI, with
                regular input messages used when you hit a button, and output
                used to tell the launchpad what colours to light up. There's
                also a few sysex messages for stuff like changing mode, how
                quickly the LEDs pulse, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I always do, I checked Nuget and found - well, nothing. So
                <i>then</i> I searched github and found a perfect[ish] package
                called launchpad-dot-net, from a user called iUltimateLP.
                Unfortunately, it didn't support my model of launchpad, only
                earlier ones, so before I could write the game, I had to rewrite
                the library to support my launchpad. That's right, baby! It's a
                project within a project!

                So I bought a midi device called a launchpad - it looks like
                this.
              </p>
              <p class="blog-img">
                <i>Image removed. That's enough of that - Ed.</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                OK so I've done my funny joke but honestly there wasn't much to
                this other than adding branches in the code for the new model of
                launchpad. The previously supported models also didn't do full
                RGB so I added the commands to fully control the LEDs
                specifically for the mini mk3.
              </p>
              <p>
                Forking this actually turned out to be really useful for my
                future work on <a href="dalamudplugins.html">LPHotbars</a> so
                I'm glad I did it, and I even did my due diligence of PRing my
                changes to the original repo. Still pending, that one. After a
                week-ish of no response from the original dev, I packaged it up
                to Nuget and shipped it for future use. Since the original dev
                never stuck the library on nuget, I felt that was... ok? I did
                worry about it at the time, but the original library is
                abandoned, so probably fair game.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, later, as mentioned, I picked this up again for LPHotbars.
                In the meantime, a very kind person called pstaszko had ported
                the library to dotnet standard 2. Which was pretty damn
                convenient, because over the course of 2024, Dalamud - the
                modding framework for Final Fantasy XIV - started targeting
                dotnet standard instead of some old version of dotnet framework.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since I was in the code, I also added a testbed app, which
                allowed me to discover a bug - the CC keys (all the labelled
                keys in the image above, the ones around the edge) and the SYSEX
                calls stopped working, so I had to fix those up.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also experimented with replacing the midi library, in an
                attempt to support linux. It wasn't successful, honestly -
                doesn't seem like any underlying midi libraries for c# actually
                properly support device comms on linux.
              </p>
              <p>
                Going one deeper and forking an actual midi library to add this
                support was out of scope for what I was working on and would
                have ballooned the project, so instead I just abandoned the
                cause. Maybe one for the future, it would be nice to offer linux
                support for LPHotbars considering how nice XIV works on
                Linux/Steam Deck.
              </p>
              <p>OK, back to the main project.</p>

              </a>
              <p>
                So once I'd rewritten the launchpad library I could actually
                make the game. I have never really got on with game engines -
                I'm largely a pure programmer, and my experiments with unity in
                the past have massively frustrated me. (Unity is a fucking
                nightmare. Has anyone else said this? JK I know they have)
              </p>
              <p>
                So instead I looked for a minimal library that would do the
                video-gamey-relevant stuff (directx instance, drawing, etc) and
                then just get out of my way.
              </p>
              <p>
                To that end, I found
                <a href="https://github.com/kylepulver/Otter">Otter2D,</a> now
                sadly discontinued. It was written by kyle pulver, who has
                worked on a bunch of things you may have heard of including
                super meat boy forever. Otter2D is exaclty what I wanted and so
                naturally it crashed and burned to the ground like Icarus, a
                library to perfect to exist.
              </p>
              <p>
                But <i>before</i> that happened, I used it for Youbeat. And it
                was really, really nice! Drawing stuff to the screen was a
                one-line affair, transitions and tweens were simple to add and
                there was reasonable variety to them, and the library itself was
                flexible enough that I could build a game that primarily
                functioned on an external device without it complaining.
              </p>
              <p>
                This has always traditionally been my problem with game dev.
                With otter, I could just write code, like I always do. I'm
                pretty good at writing code, and I'm pretty rapid too. My
                experience with engines has largely been them slowing me down
                and getting me away from the stuff that makes most sense to me.
                They're like wading through a bog.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result, this is the first time I've ever really
                <i>completed</i> a game. This was admittedly helped by me not
                really doing any level design or such, and while I did make some
                art assets for the menus there was no extensive art necessary,
                something I have always got stuck on. I know that's what
                programmer art is for but my ambitions for games tend to extend
                past prototypes and so it presents something of a psyche
                barrier.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also built a very barebones mapper! Partly so I could make my
                own beatmaps to test the game with, but also because I firmly
                believe that a good rhythm game always provides a mapper. The
                rhythm games community is pretty tight-knit and thrives on the
                free exchange of ideas and code, and so you will find that all
                the best rhythm games either ship with a mapper or release one
                shortly after they come out. It's extra work but it's good for
                the health of the game!
              </p>
              <p>
                I will admit that the mapper does kind of suck, though. It's a
                horrible archaic winforms app, but it does the job. I think if I
                wanted to dedicate more time to the project this is where I'd
                start. Ultimately though I am a firm believer in Zack Freedman's
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1j93RnIxEo"
                  ><i>Finish More Projects</i></a
                >
                mantra. When it comes to stuff you're doing for yourself, done
                is <i>always</i> better than perfect.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyway. While it may look a bit ramshackle now to my more senior
                eye, this project taught me a lot about designing for weird
                hardware, a lot about how games work when you don't have an
                engine choking you, and a few nice tidbits about nuget and such.
                Worthwhile! And hey, if you have a launchpad, you should check
                this and LPHotbars out. I'm really proud of both.
