                OK, we're doing something a little different with this one. But
                first the preamble.

                So I haven't cosplayed properly in a while. I did it prettyu
                regularly in 2023, but 2024 was a nadir for me menty h and
                cosplay, with its ill-fitting, itchy fabrics that are not
                designed with trans people in mind, was not gonna help that. I
                didn't go to many cons, those I did I avoided being in cosplay,
                yadda yadda.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thing is, is I do actually really like cosplay, when I'm of the
                frame of mind to do it. I like prop work. I like wearing the
                clothes Cat has designed for me. It's fun when it's not autistic
                agony.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may have noticed I've got mad into Fallout of late. See the
                previous entry on this blog. I've loved Fallout for a long time
                but never really considered cosplay for it, not really sure why.
              </p>
              <p>
                But this dive back into the series coincided well with me
                wanting to get back into cosplay proper. And because I want to
                do it properly, I've gone a bit all out.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've ordered a reaaaalllly nice vault 33 suit, with backpack.
                I'm gonna dye my hair instead of wearing a wig, which is the
                worst thing sensory-wise for me in cosplay.
              </p>
              <p>And, I made a Pip-Boy! Look at it here, it's pretty great!</p>
              <a href="../img/projects/pipboy/pipboy-homemade.jpg">
                <img
                  class="blog-img-lrg"
                  src="../img/projects/pipboy/pipboy-homemade.jpg"
                  alt="A photo of the home-made pip-boy in question. It looks pretty accurate but it is very very large."
                />
              </a>
              <p>It's also <i>absolutely fucking massive.</i></p>
              <p>
                Wearing it is deeply uncomfortable and my arms get tired after
                mere minutes, let alone the hours of continuous wear a con would
                require. It's impractical.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is, however, a solution. Bethesda and 'The Wand Company'
                produce a screen-accurate version of the tv series hero prop,
                which normally wouldn't particularly interest me, as often
                screen-accurate props are just display pieces and are
                non-functional.
              </p>
              <p>
                Props I use for cosplay need to have flare. I use LEDs to make
                them nicer, or in the case of my own homebrew pipboy, I was
                using a phone with an android app that mimics the Fallout 3
                pip-boy interface, fully interactable. That's cool! And it's a
                showcase!
              </p>
              <p>
                But luckily this prop also actually works. It features a lot of
                animations from the tv show, but more to the point, all the
                dials on it function and are used to interact with it. It's
                really excellent.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's expensive, though, and that alone wouldn't have been enough
                to sway me. That is, until I did a little bit of digging and
                discovered that
                <a
                  href="https://log.robco-industries.org/documentation/pipboy-3000/"
                  >the firmware is customisable, supporting custom applications
                  out of the box.</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                That's basically a red rag to a bull for me. I
                <i>love</i> writing software for esoteric things. I mean. Look
                at the projects on this website. Two of them use a midi device
                and one of them is a plugin for a videogame. I've also written
                plenty of software for and interfacing with embedded hardware.
                This is simply made for me!
              </p>
              <p>
                But if you click through the link at the top there, you'll
                notice that there's basically nothing in the repository right
                now. That's because, dear reader, we're gonna be exploring this
                hardware TOGETHER. IN REAL TIME.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's a sequence at the start of the social network where zuck
                liveblogs him making facesmash. A lot of what he writes is
                despicable, and the concept of facesmash is awful, but I dfo
                love the idea of liveblogging a project. It's not something I
                have really done before. So we're gonna do it with this one.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's a good candidate. There's some documentation at the above
                link, but not a lot, and there's lots left to explore in terms
                of how the system works. The author of the above linked article
                makes an assumption, for example - that the graphics context
                should be one bit per pixel - but I don't think that's actually
                the case. There are different tones in the monochrome screen,
                and it doesn't look like they're made using dithering. So how
                are they done? That's jsut one of many questions we will explore
                together.
              </p>
              <p>
                My ultimate aim here is to put something like the in-game stats
                screen together. When I was setting up my homemade pip-boy, I
                put some funny and personaly jokes into what stats and perks I
                picked - being able to replicate them here would be really nice.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's a long walk between here and there, though, so strap in.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, let's get one thing straight here - I'm not a teenager
                in a university dorm running on monster energy and rage. I'm a
                31 year old woman with a full-time job and a bedtime.
              </p>
              <p>
                So the 'liveblog' will not be me hacking away at this until 4AM,
                oh no no. I will be working on this off and on over the next few
                weeks most likely, and keeping this post updated as I go.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am sure you will agree that this is a much healthier choice.

                OK, so, the device itself. This is a boutique prop with
                functionality that, while not an afterthought, is certainly not
                economically worthy of any kind of custom silicon. This is a
                collector's item, there's only a few thousand of them made, best
                to use something off the shelf.
              </p>
              <p>
                And, indeed, it does! An STM32 to be exact, an absolute
                <i>classic</i> bit of IC hardware. The STM32 series are ARM
                microcontrollers, architecturally similar to the hardware in
                your common or garden smartphone. ARM is wonderful because it's
                somehow managed to succeed in all 3 corners of the 'you can only
                have two' triangle: it's [relatively] quick, it's cheap, and
                it's Good. It also sips power relative to bigger, more
                traditional chips, but that's true of any microcontroller,
                really, so shouldn't really be counted as a strength here.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was a smidge surprised to see an ARM chip in this - if this
                were a homebrew project you'd expect probably an arduino, an
                RP2040 or maybe a teensy - but this thing does have some
                relatively complex graphics to drive.
              </p>
              <p>
                I imagine the main reason this was chosen, however, was hardware
                video decoding capability. Most (maybe all?) of the show-derived
                animations are video files on-disk that are just decoded and
                straight to the graphics context. You can argue this is cheating
                if you want but to me it reeks of sensible design. Instead of
                requiring the programmers to design and animate elegantly in a
                very inelegant context (we'll get to that, believe me), you get
                the raw files made for the show, re-encode them, and plonk them
                on. Easy!
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the raw power the STM32 chip here has allows for a
                less conventional (but friendlier-ish) development context. This
                chip uses
                <a href="https://www.espruino.com/">Espruino</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Espruino is javascript for microcontrollers. Some of you may
                have just hissed, and you'd be right to. Javascript is, pretty
                infamously, horrible. It's heavy and unwieldy, it's untyped,
                it's messy, it's functional-but-not-quite. If you want an
                example of how not to design a programming language, you need
                look no further than javascript. Yet because it runs in-browser,
                it is the most common language in the world. Go figure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the words in that paragraph may have you convinced that
                javascript is a bad fit for the lean, high-performance world of
                microcontrollers, and really, you'd be right. But that hasn't
                stopped the most insane people alive, javascript monodevelopers,
                from crowbarring it into them anyway. And so: Espruino.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cards on table, I've never used Espruino before today. I've
                touched basically every other microcontroller going, and
                everything else uses C++. I'm not a great C++ programmer, but I
                can get by.
              </p>
              <p>
                Comparative to my javascript, I might as well be the Bach of
                C++. I do not like promises, I think throwing all your code to
                'some indeterminate point in the future' is a horrendous choice,
                but it's what we have to work with here, so we go with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The thing is though, in this case, this is actually a fairly
                massive strength. Because Espruino is a JS interpreter, it will
                run any valid JS you throw at it. This means you can actually
                program it interactively from a serial connection, which is
                pretty snazzy. Here's me throwing some debug code at it purely
                from the terminal and seeing it display the results in real
                time.
              </p>

                It <i>also</i> means we can dump the firmware with one line from
                the terminal and, instead of being binary and unreadable, it's
                in regular-ass javascript. Holy shit!

                As mentioned, the guy in the link above has already done this to
                some extent, but I want to dig through a bit further and
                understand a bit more what's going on. There's some very
                interesting functions here that I wanna figure out.
              </p>
              <p>
                For legal reasons, I can't share this firmware wholesale in the

                about. As we go, however, I'll screenshot various parts of the

                OK, it's 6pm, there's 3 hours until the Apprentice is on, let's
                get hacking. The first thing I need to do is, uh... take the
                thing apart.

                That's an micro-sd extender cable stringing out of it, there.
                Nearly everything that makes up the pip-boy is stored on an sd
                card which is, conveniently, not bolted into the board.

                You can open up the thing and take it out, you can copy all of
                its files over to a folder and, most usefully for us, you can
                copy those same files over to another, bigger sd card (the one
                installed is only 250MB) and it works, as long as the card is
                fat32 formatted.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've put a 32GB one in there, which is overkill, but I had it
                lying around. It also means I can put the entirety of the
                FO3/4/NV soundtracks on there, if I want. Which, maybe, I do in
                future! Who knows.
              </p>
              <p>
                More importantly, however, that SD card has a USER/ folder where
                we can drop our own custom javascript files and it'll display
                them in a nice 'APPS' menu in the INV menu.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're gonna start with the the helloWorld and graphicsTest files
                that are currently in the repo. Some file wiggling and inserting
                and removal of SD cards and bang, there they are!

                So we want tio draw something to screen that isn't just text,
                next. So I need to dive into some docs. More updates in a bit...

              <p>
                OK, first thing I want to do is draw a square. Which means we
                need to understand how the graphics buffer is working. See,
                right here, in the dump of the buffer of the main portion of the
                screen, is some interesting evidence.
              </p>

                  alt="A screenshot of an the graphics context in the pip boy firmware."
                />
              </a>
              <p>
                The interesting thing here is 'UInt8.' This is an array of 8bit
                integers. This could mean the pixels are rendered as 3-byte RGB
                values, with the r and b just ignored, or it could mean each bit
                in the byte is a pixel, and the different tones is achieved
                using dithering. Right now, I'm not sure!
              </p>
              <p>So, to find out, we're gonna draw three squares.</p>
              <a href="../img/projects/pipboy/squares.jpg">
                <img

                />
              </a>
              <p>
                And there we have it! Three squares. Now if we look at the code
                I've written, and note that the middle square is the dimmest of
                the three, we can deduce...
              </p>

              </a>
              <p>
                That I was completely wrong and the screen is compeltely
                monochrome, and any dimming is done by dithering. I'm so glad
                I'm liveblogging this so everyone can see how stupid I am.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's ok though! We're here to learn, and this actually makes
                things relatively nice and easy. I'm sure there are monochrome
                image -> uint arrays somewhere out there one the web already,
                thisn is a very common format on embedded platforms, so I just
                need to find one and run the icons for various perks etc through
                them, and we can get one displaying.
              </p>
              <p>In fact, maybe that's what we do next. BRB...</p>

                So, that's not good. In fairness, I am loading a 167x167 bitmap
                into memory here, I suppose it makes sense that that wouldn't
                exactly work. But it is going to make this more difficult.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next question then. What is a reasonable maximum array size we
                can use here? Time to experiment. We'll start with half the
                resolution, 83x83.

                OK, it's displaying, but that's clearly not right. Here's what

                That's ok though, there's options on the converter for just this
                predicament. This was the default (Horizontal - 1bpp), and
                Vertical - 1bpp landed similar results, so let's move on from
                that converter and use the one hosted on
                <a href="https://www.espruino.com/Image+Converter"

                instead. Man I'm really proving myself soooo smart today.

                Using the right tool for the job gives us this! And it's even

                OK, that's real, genuine progress. We can encode images and
                display them, which we need for the perks screen. They are
                pretty big though, so I think next order of business is going to
                be keeping those strings in text files and loading them in when
                we need to. Back to the docs... Although I might leave it there
                tonight, my back hurts. No wonder Zuck had to be 19 to do this
                live.

              <p>Evening! Let's get right back to work.</p>
              <p>
                Yesterday, we figured out how to correctly convert and display
                an image on the screen. Today,we're going to figure out storing
                those images, loading them at runtime, and switching to another
                image later.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, first up: storing and loading the image. This is gonna need
                me to look up how the espruino fs library works. BRB...

                Well that was tremendously easy. First try baby, finally I'm not
                completely stupid about something! We're gaming! I would take a
                photo of the screen but I didn't change the image's position so
                it looks exactly the same. but rest assured it is there!
              </p>
              <p>OK, next up, we swap images on the fly.</p>

              <p>
                Done! Again! Wow we're going win after win today. Apart from the
                weird bit of artifacting in the top left of the image there,
                but, er... I'm sure that's fine. Let's ignore it for now. We'll
                see if it continues with other images.
              </p>
              <p>
                OK, so this is actually a fair cut through the work we need to
                do here. So let's structure the screen a bit, and add the name
                and descriptions.
