                We'll start with the simple one. NICEDamage is a stupid,
                half-day joke project I made to get to grips with FFXIV modding.
                Final Fantasy XIV has damage numbers displayed on screen for all
                attacks, from and to the player. Each of these numbers can have
                an additional caption if they're affected a debuff or something,
                e.g. sometimes on icnoming damage you'll see 5836! (15%
                Parried). NICEDamage utilises this caption such that if a damage
                number ends in 69, the caption reads NICE! That's it. It has
                over ten <i>thousand</i> downloads.

                Ok, this one's a bit more complex. For another, previous
                project, I bought a Launchpad Mini, a MIDI input device with RGB
                lighting on each key. It looks like this.

              keyboard-like device made up of a grid of translucent RGB
              squares."

              <p>
                I got a little bit bored one weekend and decided to map this fun
                device to Final Fantasy XIV's hotbars. It actually maps pretty
                well - I put some different colour mapping in such that
                cooldowns for the actions are demonstrated by the colour on the
                button - and there's extra colours for when an action is combo'd
                from another one. It's really cool, and I'm really happy with
                it! It's fully mappable and should in-theory work with other
                models of the launchpad.
