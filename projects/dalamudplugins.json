NICEDamage is a stupid, half-day joke project I made to get to grips with FFXIV modding. Final Fantasy XIV has damage numbers displayed on screen for all attacks, from and to the player. Each of these numbers can have an additional caption if they\u0027re affected a debuff or something, e.g. sometimes on icnoming damage you\u0027ll see 5836! (15% Parried). NICEDamage utilises this caption such that if a damage number ends in 69, the caption reads NICE! That\u0027s it. It has over ten thousand downloads."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"LPHotbars"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"2024"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Ok, this one\u0027s a bit more complex. For another, previous project, I bought a Launchpad Mini, a MIDI input device with RGB lighting on each key. It looks like this."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I got a little bit bored one weekend and decided to map this fun device to Final Fantasy XIV\u0027s hotbars. It actually maps pretty well - I put some different colour mapping in such that cooldowns for the actions are demonstrated by the colour on the button - and there\u0027s extra colours for when an action is combo\u0027d from another one. It\u0027s really cool, and I\u0027m really happy with it! It\u0027s fully mappable and should in-theory work with other models of the launchpad."}]}
